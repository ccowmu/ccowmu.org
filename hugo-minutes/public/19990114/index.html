Sign up. We need more people to sell coursepacks. If interested, contact Wes.</p><p></li><li>Linux install party (after they fix 5.2). X is broken on Wes&rsquo;s machine. Jettero and his roommate had problems with 5.2 and was forced to move back to 5.1. No party scheduled at this time. Maybe in February.</p><p></li><li>Annual trip to Chicago. Battletech is gone. Let&rsquo;s visit the Plane-arium! Looking for ideas&mldr;doesn&rsquo;t have to be in Chicago. Tim located Battletech in a place called Dave & Buster&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s located at 1030 N. Clark, Chicago, IL. Yes!!!</p><p></li><li>CD-rewritables&mldr;buy, buy, buy!!! We&rsquo;ll have to wait on the coursepack situation first.</p><p></li><li>Found information on net-radio. Shoutcast, which works with Winamp (an M3 player), is available. Can be a server on any os, running through a Win machine with Winamp. &lsquo;Pirate&rsquo; radio, here we come! Bandwidth would be high. Possible UCC problem could occur. We could stream WIDR, with THEIR PERMISSION. Windows needed on the &lsquo;station&rsquo; end. Jettero suggests we could provide an NT box to WIDR to send the signal to us.</p><p>Who would be interested in this endeavour? Tim, Isaac, Brian, Wesley volunteer. Tim suggests a Furby radio station&mldr;<em>silence</em> Ozz votes to ban Furby and Barney (EVIL).</p><p></li><li>VMS machines&mldr;.oh, no. Wes joined DECUS (can we call it COMPAQUS?)

Wes, Tim volunteered.</p><p></li><li>Web pages&mldr;Dr. Trenary suggests we talk to Floyd about student web pages. Let&rsquo;s go to Dr. Floyd.</p><p></li><li>News server&mldr;do we want one?</p><p></li><li>Robot&mldr;to wander down the hall. Let&rsquo;s get K9 working. Maybe programming with a robot.</p><p></li><li>Elections. Brian nominated for secretary last meeting. Paul nominated for VP of ops. Brian elected to secretary.
