We need to advertise. Wes got us into the phone book. We&rsquo;ll be in Glances. Possibly an advertisement on cs motd.</p><p></li><li>Business/fundraising op. Someone from Excel contacted us about hooking up with Excel communications. Possibly making money for club. Ozz suggests this is a Tupperware version of Long Distance. Pyramid Scheme? <em>yuck</em> A 1-900-XXX-SEXX line would be more acceptable. Maybe a porn site? No&mldr;we tried that! :^)</p><p></li><li>Listbot list called cclub newsletter. To subscribe, contact <a href=http://cclub_newsletter.listbot.com>http://cclub_newsletter.listbot.com</a>. Maybe we need a few new aliases, like president, etc.</p><p></li><li>Treasurer&rsquo;s report: $60 from stuff sale and $570 from coursepacks.</p><p></li><li>Linux install party next week: We need to advertise in Glances. RSVP. Ozz says we can get a few disks burned. We will try to advertise with CS dept. Somebody needs to make up signs and stick them on campus NOW. Food: pop & snacks. Bring your own machine or hard drive (preferably the whole machine).</p><p></li><li>More office hours. We could use them. CS people don&rsquo;t wake up early, so not a big deal for morning. :^)</p><p></li><li>Cleaning&mldr;the office is a total STY. Cleaning is not difficult&mldr;give it a try.</p><p></li><li>ACM competition. Ozz detailed some benefits of joining programming team. Sep 16-17 from 5-8 PM. Let&rsquo;s bring some people in and blow Kapenga&rsquo;s mind.</p><p></li><li>We should notify some cs profs about coursepacks. It is probably a good idea to let the CS dept know that we can sell them. No reason to stop at CS.</p><p></li><li>CS web page. Kaminski may need help. Paul contacted Kaminski with an offer to help.</p><p></li><li>Peirce. We need to deliver a security report on our current situation.</p><p></li><li>Sun 3 workstations. Selling DEC crap would be bad, since lose money in shipping.</p><p></li><li>Web pages issue. Contact El Presidente Elson Floyd.</p><p></li><li>IEEE. Let&rsquo;s open dialogue.</p><p></li><li>Forwarding account <a href=mailto:XXX@alum.wmich.edu>XXX@alum.wmich.edu</a> for those who graduate. Call up the Alumni Assoc and sell them on the idea.</p><p></li><li>Adjourned at 7:03. Jay votes we go to Pilsen Club, get loaded, and spend club money. Leonard, Jay says HELLO.</p><p></li></ol></p></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
