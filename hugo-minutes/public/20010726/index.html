Why is John living in the office, etc.? John says: "Why not?" He says we need bigger animal crackers.</p><p>6. WHO ARE YOU?!! Who is your daddy and what does he do?</p><p>7. Rodger is working on some fliers. People at Wes' party got a sneak peak last week. Isaac is working on business cards too.</p><p>8. T-shirts. Anne-marie needs to know shirt col, logo (and how many colors), and we need to make sure Western's logo appears correctly on the shirt. Everyone should recommend their T-shirt designs so we can get estimates and decide which design we'll go with. We only have a month to do this.</p><p>9. We're having another meeting next week.</p><p>10. $10 for the account and web page and an additional $10 for us to administer. Anyone (even non-university organizations) can be a part of this.
