We should try to take the new vice prez out to lunch and show that we can be kind, gentle, caring people hehe.
Let Ozz know if you wanna go, he'll let everyone know if she bought in.</p><p>10. Gamer's Guild - shut servers down to conserve energy on weekends, holidays, etc.
wmgg was put on yakko (but not active) to help them out. Looking for other ways to help them out, like get them a domain.
It's on yakko.cs.wmich.edu/wmgg right now, but once again, not active.
Look at pages and see if there is anything objectionable and we could possibly put them on one of the computer club's unused IPs.
Use a secondary machine as a server. Think about if we want to do it, and what happens if we do do it. Do we want a lot of credit?
Next week.</p><p>11. Constitutional Law Scholar at Harvard, Laurence Lessig, suggests looking at Internet for its Constitutional value.
Biz, Polisci, soc, writers, media, journalism, anyone interested in privacy, would find this speaker interesting/useful.
Could help get other speakers as well. Funds are needed to get him here though, Chris will try to find bio info about him, possibly
from his secretary. Split up people and send to various depts. to bum cash for this.<br>Go here to find out more: <a href=http://ethics.harvard.edu/people/affiliates/lessig.html>http://ethics.harvard.edu/people/affiliates/lessig.html</a></p><p>12.
