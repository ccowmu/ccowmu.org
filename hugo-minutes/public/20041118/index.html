It is a way to automatically
re-register us rather than having to file with the OCL every year.<p></p></li><li><p>Tim suggests that we do another Chicago trip.<br>We stopped going years ago and perhaps we could resume our trips. Perhaps it&rsquo;s
a good idea, but Joe voiced concerns about the possibility of bad weather.<p></p></li><li><p>Meeting degenerated into useless banter.<p></p></li><li><p>Isaac suggested that we fix the connection on the DOSAweb server so that
Computer Club doesn&rsquo;t have a broken link.<br></p></li></ol><p>It kind of looks bad.<p></p><ol start=5><li><p>Status of WIDR<br>Isaac informed us that he contacted WIDR and advised them that moving their web
pages to our machine would not be a good idea, but we have no objections to
keeping the WIDR stream in their office.<p></p></li><li><p>Meeting adjourned at 6:48 P.M.</p></li></ol></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
