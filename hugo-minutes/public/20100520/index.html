We&rsquo;re not sure if we trust ourselves to not break FCC rules (i.e. we are immature rather than armature). FCC rules don&rsquo;t allow for anything fun (no encryption, etc, what&rsquo;s the point?)<br><br>MAME cabinet discussion - Do we have enough drive space? Probably, but butters would like more. We are going to document everything we do to make the system work, and turn it into a script to modify a stock/standard Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) LTS install. After we get the system built, Zerg would like to get a cap kit for the monitor and repaint the cabinet. Rancor would like to wait until after Bronco Bash to work on aesthetic changes of the machine.<br><br>PLAN - We should probably think about getting in touch with Cotton about VLAN scripts. What will be brought to Parkview, do we need a truck? Possibly we&rsquo;ll bring a fridge and some candy. Not anticipating a large turn out for the Summer PLAN as they generally are not, and we have not been aggressively advertising.<br><br>Meeting adjourned by rancor at 18:42</p></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
