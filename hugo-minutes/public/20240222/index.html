it excecutes instructions, thats it</p><p>What is a program
A set of instructions
Binary code & source code
you can modify the source
computer reads binary</p><p>Control
to control the computer you must control the programs</p><p>What is free
Free implies liberty freedom</p><p>Free v proprietary
if software is free you can control it
if its proprietary you cannot</p><pre><code>4 levels of freedom
    freedom to run 
    freedom to inspect and modify source 
    Freedom to share software
    freedom to share a modified program 

0 and 1 protect individual freedom while 2 and 3 give freedom to distribute

Free != open source
    free is owning and controlling and modifing 
    wheras open source is the argument that opsn source is better since everyone can be modified 

non free software corrupts
    if you write non free software you control users
    inspires people to create malware

Malware
    software that hurts other people 
    Malware is not just makwar
</code></pre><p>Missing features
the only thing open source worries about
if free has a bug you can fix it
if a software is not free you cannot fix anything</p><p>Knowledge
the crux of the free software movement
the more people know the better they can be</p><p>gnu
project started by richard stallman in 1984
wanted to make a free operating system</p><p>gnu inux
Gnu needed a kernal and linux was that kernal</p><p>Not just the OK
its everything that it runs on as well
the internet is also a problem</p><p>Intel managment engine
its a chip in your CPU
can read all memory, access network
more privleged than any software
its not free</p><p>Kibreboot
used to free boot firware/ IME
its a distro of coreboot</p><p>Practical considerations
install gnu linux
slowely replace non free servies
You will have to have some sacrafices
Be an advocate for the free software movement</p><h3 id=dinner-at-wings>Dinner at wings</h3></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
