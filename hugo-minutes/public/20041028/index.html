general consensus was that it&rsquo;s not doable at this time.<p></p><p>3> Lan party<br>Tournaments will be for Doom 3 and UT2k4. 16 player double elimination. It
will be tight, so we will need dedicated servers to be running the whole time.
Prizes will include $50 gift cards for Best Buy. It might be crazy due to the
time constraints. Brian has developed a time structure. Joe asks for a copy
of the schedule.<p></p><p>Brian would like to offer a intranet site for people to register their
teams.<p></p><p>Tim, Brian and Eric made flyers. The flyers were submitted to OSL. They have
