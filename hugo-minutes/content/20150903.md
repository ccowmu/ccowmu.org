#Computer Club Minutes, September 3rd, 2015

There was no weekly meeting today due to the Parkview Passport event. We are looking forward to seeing any new members that learned about our club through this first-year student engagement activity. We'd also like to thank the current members that volunteered to help with setting up and tearing down equipment in our room at Parkview. Our first meeting of the Fall semester will take place next thursday, September 10th.
