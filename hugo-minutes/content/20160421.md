# Weekly Meeting Minutes, April 21st, 2016

- Minutes by cpg
- Head Count: 23

# PLAN

- The official date for PLAN XXV has been set to November 12th, 2016!
- cpg will be working with the other officers and volunteers over the summer to make this PLAN the best one yet.

# Orientation Involvement Zones

- cpg has signed us up for a table at the freshman orientation involvement zones over the summer.
- Please sign up for times to volunteer to run the table [here](http://worf.co/GcJ9a). Every freshman is required to participate in orientations, so this is a great promotional opportunity and any help is appreciated.
