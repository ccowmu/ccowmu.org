Computer Club meeting minutes for 10/07/2004<br>
Members present: Ed, Chris, Joe, Brian, Miles, Eric, Tim<p>

1> Dot was down for a few hours.  <br>
We're blaming one of those ECE guys for pulling the plug or something.  Anyway,
it's plugged in now.<p>

2> We really need keys to this building<br>
Eric also needs help with the office.<p>

3> Presentation switcheroo<br>
Tim bailed out due to excessive studying.
Chris offered to do a voip-asterisk.
Eric offered to do GTK programming.
Other topics were suggested.  If you would like to present on something, send
email on officers.<p>

4> Lan party - Nov. 6th at Parkview Campus<br>
Room is reserved from friday to saturday midnight.  $5 preregister, $10 at
door.  We haven't officially got permission from the dean, yet, but John is
covering that.<p>

When should we start advertising?  Permission is a prerequisite.  We'll have to
do a detailed inventory, so they can't accuse us of breaking stuff.
Apparently, this was a problem with the last lan party, even though what they
accused us of breaking was noticed a week after the party.<p>

5> WIDR is po'ed about the WIDR stream.<br>
We can't really do anything about the VLAN situation, but some discussion was
made about feeding the stream to a machine in Parkview from a machine in the
office.<p>

6> Adjourned at 6:30.<p>
