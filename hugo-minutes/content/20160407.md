# 90 Days of Git

- hellbacon and pasportit have engaged in a coding initiative called "90 Days of Git." The purpose of this is to increase your Github presence and encourage more coding in general by writing some code and committing it to Github each day.
- Anyone can get involved in this, and join the #90daysofgit channel if you want to discuss your progress and ask questions.
- There is a [page](https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu/wiki/GitHub_Pages) on the wiki with a list of links to members' Github pages. If you would like to share your Github account and gain followers, add your own to this page.
