2.  BNC is okay.  An IRC thingy.</p><p>
3.  Shall we turn the finger daemon?  The answer is yes! External fingering is no longer allowed.  inetd has been reconfigured.</p><p>
4.  Movie pary at Wes's on April 22nd?  Let's vote.  We are at a loss.  Let's decide next week.  Better to put it off than to have to think today.</p><p>
