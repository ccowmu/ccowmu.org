## Free Software
Talk by Reznee

What is a computer
    it excecutes instructions, thats it

What is a program
    A set of instructions 
    Binary code & source code
    you can modify the source
    computer reads binary

Control
    to control the computer you must control the programs 

What is free
    Free implies liberty freedom

Free v proprietary
    if software is free you can control it
    if its proprietary you cannot

    4 levels of freedom
        freedom to run 
        freedom to inspect and modify source 
        Freedom to share software
        freedom to share a modified program 
    
    0 and 1 protect individual freedom while 2 and 3 give freedom to distribute

    Free != open source
        free is owning and controlling and modifing 
        wheras open source is the argument that opsn source is better since everyone can be modified 
    
    non free software corrupts
        if you write non free software you control users
        inspires people to create malware
    
    Malware
        software that hurts other people 
        Malware is not just makwar

Missing features
    the only thing open source worries about 
    if free has a bug you can fix it
    if a software is not free you cannot fix anything 


Knowledge
    the crux of the free software movement
    the more people know the better they can be

gnu
    project started by richard stallman in 1984
    wanted to make a free operating system

gnu inux
    Gnu needed a kernal and linux was that kernal

Not just the OK
    its everything that it runs on as well
    the internet is also a problem

Intel managment engine
    its a chip in your CPU
    can read all memory, access network
    more privleged than any software
    its not free

Kibreboot
    used to free boot firware/ IME
    its a distro of coreboot

Practical considerations
    install gnu linux
    slowely replace non free servies
    You will have to have some sacrafices
    Be an advocate for the free software movement
