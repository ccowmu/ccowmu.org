The following binary assets should be manually copied to support legacy paths:

1. Duplicate the `css` directory:
   - Source: `minutes/css/`
   - Destination: `minutes/minutes/css/`

2. Duplicate the `js` directory:
   - Source: `minutes/js/`
   - Destination: `minutes/minutes/js/`

3. Copy the favicon file:
   - Source: `minutes/favicon.ico`
   - Destination: `minutes/minutes/favicon.ico`

4. Duplicate required images:
   - Source: files in `minutes/images/` used by minutes pages
   - Destination: `minutes/minutes/images/`

These copies allow older URLs under `minutes/minutes/` to continue working.
