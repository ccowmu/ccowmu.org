Members present: Tim Miley, Darron Christian, Wesley Leonard, Isaac Rzonca, Kelly Weaver, Gabriel Ripoche, Aaron, Arvell. </p><p>
1) Pirate RADIO, internet style.  Frogfarm and tmiley thought of setting up a radio station on the internet.  Initially, we could parrot WIDR, with their permission.  We could also start our own programming.  Legal issues were brought up, along with bandwidth issues.  Equipment issues.  Wesley agreed to do some research.  Isaac said he would look up the legal issues. </p><p>
