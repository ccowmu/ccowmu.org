Minutes for the Computer Club of Western Michigan University. 11-10-05<br>
Members attending: Matt R., Joe W, Miles, Joe G., Jason and Craige.<br>
Time started: 6:21PM<br>
We have finalized the rest of the Presentation schedule.  Joe W. will have a presentation next week on Open GL.  Two week following thanksgiving we will be having a presentation on Open Questionaire.<br>
<br>
We still owe Joe G. Money for the phone bill, and Craig money for the Bawls.<br>
PLAN 5:<br>
Brian is thinking of having a one day LAN 12PM-4AM<br>
tacos.<br>
more tacos.<br>
Needless rambling, idividuals are going on about their classes.<br>
Yakko has been updated. (updated hard ware, etc.)<br>
Joe W. Wants the firewall swapped already so we can get a VPN to the office up.<br>
The computer club office now has 2 machines. One machine is a NAT firewall, the other machine is designated for more pratical uses.<br>
The NAT has dual displays and processors.  The pratical machine contains a Geforece 4MX 420, and has a sound card routed into an old stereo with house speakers on shelves.<br>
This was done to promote use of the office, and make the office a more comfortable environment for office hours.<br>
Soon we'd like to NAT the office to YAKKO so we can have share mounted remotely using NFS.<br>
Time Ajourned: 6:58PM<br>
