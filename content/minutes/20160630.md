### Constitution
- WMU has contacted us to tell us that we are required to update our constitution.
- They need to know what will happen to Computer Club's funds in the possible event that Computer Club dissolves.
- Charity options were considered for when the new constitution is due.
- We also need to know when the RSO status expires.
- We will try to make this decision when the semester starts and more people can come to the Computer Club meetings.

### Events
- Showcase Saturday and Coding Challenge Sunday canceled this weekend due to the holidays.
  - These events will return next weekend.
- The next Showcase Saturday on July 9th has a cash prize: create the most complicated "Hello world" program as possible.
