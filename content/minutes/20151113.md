# Snack discussion
  - Idea was variety, certain things didn't sell as well
    - Work on optimizing most profitable things
  - NO GIANT BAG OF POPCORN
  - Pizza and pop sold well
    - On Sunday, get a lot less pizza
  - Mountain dew, coke most popular drinks
    - Stick to regular monster, don't need special kinds
  - Skip pop tarts or buy less
  - Chips/pretzels all in same category, make this more distinct for next PLAN?

  - Bottom line, candy and soda are best

# Scheduling
  - Saturday is just more popular, Sunday is still dead
  - Start on Saturday around noon, make event continuous overnight as long as possible?
    - Sunday for only cleanup
    - Move Magic to Friday night?
    - Longer Saturday and ignore Sunday
    - 97% of profits made on Saturday
  - Project M not as popular, stick to Melee?
  - Magic and Hearthstone at separate times, not at the same time.
    - Put on Saturday

# Drugs
  - Issues with Adderall
    - No, really
  - Update to add rule against non-perscribed drugs

# Tournaments
  - Optimize the CS:GO tournament more, finals went on went too long
  - Riot should only prize to first 5 places
    - Determining tiebreakers is essential so we can avoid confusion
  - Structuring tournaments needs to be more decisive
  - Spectating or streaming by players is not allowed without talking to the tournament director first
  - Get summoner names from League people, these are important

# Prizes
  - We need prizes sooner in advance so we can advertise them better
  - Prizes are important as an advertising utility, we should prepare for more people coming to PLAN next semester

# Planning next PLAN
  - Soon we should start planning for Spring PLAN
    - Plan around the Spring schedule so we do it after midterms
    - Mid-late march or early April
      - Possibly late March
  - Replace TF2 with something else
    - Start thinking about a different game
      - Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm?
  - Keep Rocket League tournament, turned out to be popular
  - Dota 2 also went well
