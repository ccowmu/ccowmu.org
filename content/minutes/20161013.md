### PLAN

  - We are not able to get many sponsors to respond.
  - If you can give us information about how to get more sponsors, please let us know.
- Our goal is to receive money or prizes from sponsors.
- Soon we will be going to local places in person to find sponsors.
- There is also a Facebook event now available. See it here: https://www.facebook.com/events/154484321677898/.
  - Send it to all of your friends!

### Projector
- We probably won't be able to use other Kohrman Hall rooms for talks.
- Since we can't use another projector, we will have to consider options for getting our own projector for talks.

### Router
- We may need a new router, since we are currently encountering problems with our current office router.
- Details about these issues will be discussed as we determine them.
- Possible replacement routers will be considered when we get more information.

### Backups
- hellbacon is still looking to get a new server for backups. The price range may be between $600 and $700.
- Some refurbished servers are also being considered, with one option being around $800.
  - The specs are 8 cores, 96 GB of RAM, and 10 TB of storage.
  - Here is a link if you would like more information: http://www.ebay.com/itm/181390661208.
  - Depending on heat output, we are planning on putting this server in Parkview.
  - If we cannot put it in Parkview, it will be put in the Computer Club office.
- This server will also be used for projects, assignments, or virtual machines for Computer Club members.
- Thanks to typo for contributing funds to help us get this new server!

### IBM Workshop
