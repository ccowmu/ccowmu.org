no one's done any fundraiser stuff.<br />
We're not going to talk about how we're going to store email addresses.<br />
We're going to write the script for now and deal with where to store them later.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
  Butters sent an email to cotton about a subnet for PLAN<br />
  <br />
Mame Cabinet:<br />
  We've got it sanded!<br />
  Working on it after the meeting.<br />
  Staining black?  Might require some careful sanding.<br />
  Painting black?  not as pretty.<br />
  The cabinet is covered in wood filler so staining would be a bad idea.<br />
