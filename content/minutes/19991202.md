1) AI Cusp has develop a tool for doing research over the internet.  It allows the person to search for a term like "Democracy" which gives real quotes from famous people like Madison in Federalist Papers, including Bibliography.  In addition, it gives context back to the citation, or a "so what" to learn what it means.  What they want to do with CClub is offer us a way to fundraise.   </p><p>
