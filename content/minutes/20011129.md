1. Computer Club Christmas Party, who's gonna be around to have it?  Where's it gonna be?  Meet in the club office, Saturday the 8th at 4:00pm.  Matt'll  send out and announcement. </p><p>
2. Mailing lists for next semester: asking for people to renew.  Also be on the lookout for potential lists.  Rodger was talking about putting up some flyers to advertise as well. </p><p>
3. The AlgoStore project.  The database has been created but has no tables. We need to set that up.  We also need to see who else wants to be involved. </p><p>
4. Next semester we also need to remember to reserve a room for KLUG. </p><p>
5. Eric Raymond: we want him but he's very expensive so we should try to get funding by February to get him in. </p><p>
6. Wes is starting a business called West Michigan Computing Services and will donate money to the club if all goes well.  Best of luck Wes! </p><p>
7. Treasurer's Report:  We have $945.29 in our account!  Holy cow!  That's because we haven't restocked our snack shelves... </p>
