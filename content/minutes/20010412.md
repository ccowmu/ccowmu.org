1. Erik's going to keep trying to get Bionic Arm to whip up some CDs and maybe make a theme song for the computer club. </p><p>
2. Vouchers are in for Uberyakko, people who pitched in should be getting payed soon. </p><p>
3. Bob was talking about the Geek Group.  How'd they get their own building? They like playing with Tesla coils.  They get their money from having a legit business that makes big bucks.  Wes was curious about how we could learn from them so that the computer club could eventually get a building of their own. </p><p>
4. T-shirt idea:  Getting DigiLink to partially sponsor the Computer Club so we can get our own T-shirts. </p><p>
5. The Computer Club could get their own business cards from VistaPrint for free. </p>
