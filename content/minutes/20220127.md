# STEM Fair
 - Febuary 9th in the Bernhard Center in the Ballroom from 10am to 1pm, virtual is 3-6pm
 - Employers may be different at both so it may be worth going to both
 - Online requires registration
# Denso coming back
 - Cafe Critque is a good way for resume critiquing
 - Hiring managers will come talk to you about how to make your resume better
 - You will want to bring a printed out version of your resume
 - You can also email your resume to wmuhandshake@wmich.edu and have it reviewed that way
 - In person is generally recommended for better feedback

# Career Zone
 - Career zone is open and is good for resume critques
 - They will try to help you find internships or jobs after graduation
 - Always a good idea to get your resume reviewed

# Pi Day
 - March 14
 - It is a big fundraiser day for all RSOs through engineering department
 - All money that is donated during that event goes straight to RSO
 - A pie eating contest is also being pushed very heavily
 - There are prizes depending on donations
 - If you know someone who wants to donate please let them know

# Student Events
 - Open houses for students that are already incoming to Western.
 - One upcoming one is for Honors College students in particular
 - Scott is out with COVID so we may have a bit of a delay in what we need
 - 1/28 has a bunch of new students, so be nice to them

# Western Weekend
 - WMU holding new event on April 2nd, this is a Saturday
 - We don't really know what it is but we should be prepared to participate, it may be a recruiting event
 - It will be held at the bernhard

# Science Olympiad
 - Weekend of March 19
 - Middle and High Schoolers will be taken to Western to do small science projects
 - Our event will be called "WiFi Lab"
 - This is the first time we will be doing this event.
 - You get a free tshirt for showing up and working

# Blacktops
 - Kharl is putting together manufacturting plan with Stryker for blacktops
 - These should really help students in 2230
 - We will have to make choice on how many we need to make
 - 80 will be need to cover this semester and summer classes, 140 will be needed for adding fall semester
 - Semi Conducter shortage is making this quite a bit harder than it should be.
 - Many circuit boards have already been made but we need to populate boards with parts
 - There is a lot of decision making that needs to be made in #officers for this decision
 - Stryker has been very useful in this project
 - Stryker is using newer pick and place robots that need a new file format that KiCad does not produce
 - Kharl should be able to send new panel design to Stryker
 - Hopefully Stryker should be able to complete board manufacturing automatically as well.
 - Will need to do another solder party to solder and test boards.

# Synth
 - We are currently building a modular synth
 - This is an analog synth that is composed of multiple modules to generate music
 - They are generally put into a rack similar to a server, allowing you to hook the signal generators and modifiers together to make interesting sounds
 - We should start putting it together soon.
 - It would be cool to take it to Bronco Bash and show new students music that was made by a machine club built

# Lockpick Set
 - Flay will be sending us a new lockpicking kit so we can teach lockpicking again

# Hackathon
 - Hosting hackathon in early April

# Migration
 - We are currently working on migrating chat, vault, website, and wiki.
 - After chat is moved we will wipe dot, allowing us to host other stuff using the machine
 - Waiting for ccawmu.org domain transfer from typo, for now he can manually enter DNS records
 - Migration is going to server on Linode instead of locally.
 - We may be able to request money from school to pay for costs.

# Linux Install Party
 - Next week we will be doing a Linux install party.
 - This is a very good idea for any students in 2230 or 3240
 - This is a good idea for any other students that are not in 2230 or 3240 as well.
