### MHacks
- Last weekend, dolphin, kessler, and chibiskuld went to the MHacks event in Ann Arbor. Today at the meeting, dolphin and kessler told us about their experience.
  - The event lasted 36 hours and they were provided with facilities and places to work. The event was free and is held every semester.
  - About 500 other people had attended the event.
  - There was free food and meals for everyone.
  - They told us it was a fun way to collaborate, take part in workshops (For more info about these, ask kessler, he went to many workshops), and work on other projects.
  - They advised that everyone should check it out and dolphin offered to drive again if anyone needed to carpool.
  - They said it was good opportunity to learn, too, as dolphin learned more python.
- chibiskuld and one of our new computer club members worked on an android application called MList that lists media. It aims to track shows and movies you watch, books you read, and games you play.
  - If you would like to help with its continuing development, they will be working on it after the meeting in the Computer Club office every week.
