Minutes taken by Ming

alu, adam, chago, estlin, kv, blip, ming, jeon + 2 person

no meeting next week because of thanksgiving, no dinner and spend time with your family

finals week is coming by fast
we'll do a study party and invite other orgs as well

SWE are still doing a fundraiser with Kalamazoo candles

We ordered the rest of the MSP430 and we'll ordered enough for 50? 60?

We will have to do elections soon this semester, we will need a new secretary and VP of finance. Meeting before finals week will be the voting week. I don't think we will have meeting after finals. 8th is nominations, 15th is elections.

Happy thanksgiving guys 

Be safe driving home in this snowy weather.
