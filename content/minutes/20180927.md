### DT Issue

* if you are a cs student, or ceas student, we pay differential tuition

* it is for undergraduate success

* the dean wants to start a biomed engineering degree

* he is using the differential tuition funds to fund this

* if you don't like this, 

* they are starting biomed graduates this fall

* there will be massive cs 1200 aka c for engineers influx without funding

* the board of trustees may not know what is going on with this

* the dt fund is not being dispersed very evenly

* if you go to [here](https://wmich.edu/trustees), you can contact them

* Susan Bott is also contactable

* if we draft correspondence, we may be able to turn heads

* possibly a one page letter

* if we can get other rsos on board, that would be more effective

* sphinx will put some more info in officers

* budget is ditributed to ceas from the main campus, not necessarily based on its student body
