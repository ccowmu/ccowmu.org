Computer Club Meeting :  November 21, 1996 </p><p>
1. Members present: tim, steve, darron, darren, jake, lara, mike </p><p>
2. Chicago trip: 	-We will be planning a trip to the windy city.  Any 	 ideas for an itinerary contact Tim. Right now it looks 	 as though it may be a do what you want party fest.  The  	 majority idea is that structure sucks, everyone for themselves. </p><p>
3. Wiley...Is that you? 	-Couldn't do the NIS thing. So Wiley is mounted to yakko such 	 that everyone who has an account on yakko, can log 	 onto wiley using their yakko account. 	-Wiley is a Pentium 100 machine with 32 megs of memory.  	-Can only change password on Yakko, can't do it on wiley. 	-If you notice any errors while on wiley, please email 	 root with a description of the problem. </p><p>
4. History: 	-Looking to generate a history of the Computer Club. 	 Anyone who has aspirations in researching ground 	 breaking accomplishments or divulging past  	 C-Club actions of members contact Tim.  Don't worry, 	 plausible deny-ability will be accepted. </p><p>
5. Constitution: 	Tim still wants to ratify the old constitution and  	bring it more up to date.  Who, what, when and where 	has yet to be established. </p><p>
6. Meeting ended 6:45 pm. </p><p>
