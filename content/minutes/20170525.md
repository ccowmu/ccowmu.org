### General

- Wakko on top of Yakko is stable. And is now hosting a chat client called riot.
- Login to the new chat:
        - in browser search cclub.cs.wmich.edu/vector
        - Login with nick and password
- Slack membership is almost up so begin migrating over.
- Jazz is the next project

#### Side issue
- An Alum on slack wanted to create a bot we alowed him too.
- He set up a bot that pulled from chat from general and routed it to another chat.
- The bot is shut down, but if you have any problems with this issue let karhl know
