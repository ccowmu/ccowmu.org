## Student Ambassadors and Tutors

Scott is looking for Student Ambassadors over the Summer.

Furthermore, the Student Success Center is also still looking for tutors. Tutoring for a given class requires a B or better in that class.

## Bronco Bash and Passport Day

Bronco Bash happens during welcome week, but Passport Day will be before that. We want to attend both of them to engage with students and recruit new members. 

## Arcade Cabinets

Hopefully we will have our miniature arcade cabinet completed by Passport Day and we can take it with us. At some point, we will also need to arrange for the large arcade cabinet to be transported from Parview (where it has been in storage for this past semester's Student Events) to Club room.

This purchase was approved, with a total cost of $40.
