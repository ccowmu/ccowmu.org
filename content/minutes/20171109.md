### Possible Loaner Laptop

- Sphinx proposes that club buy a few loaner laptops for those in need of laptops in the program

- Although laptops are required for the CS program sometimes students run into issue midway through a semester and need a quick temporary solution

- Possibly a cheap refurbished (i.e. Lenovo Thinkpads or Dell Latitudes) 

- Much planning and thought are required to approve and practically implement this idea, but it would be a valuable resource to the club and the department


### Future Opportunity in the System Administration Department
