> 6:00 PM, On a Thursday, on google meet

## Welcome back
* introduction of any new members
* one new member: hammer

## Distancing Plans
* for now, all meetings will be online
* investigating a different platform than google meet to enable an "online club room" that people can just drop in to
* google meet doesn't allow this functionality
* jitsi looks like a good alternative and is self-hosted
* also complies with the accessibility standards set by the university
* just need web browser to join meetings

* access to club room fairly limited
* kohrman is *technically* open mon-thurs 7:00am-9:30pm
* still, please talk to an officer if you want to physically be there, there are limits to the amount of people that can be in a room
* plan is to disinfect about once a month or so, but still clean up after yourself
* girrockss picked up disinfectant and will be out for people to disinfect the areas you interacted with 

### requirements for using the club room:
* ask an officer first
* wear a mask if there is someone else in the room
* disinfect whatever you touch
* distance- this means multiple people can't use a single part of the club room at once (elect. workbench etc)

## Event Plans
* career talk by Kevin khaw
* former highering manager at google
* "an inside look into hiring at google"
* either Sept 24 or Oct 1
* thanks, alu for organizing this!

* game jam soon (1-2 weeks from now probably)
* new format
* still 48 hours but you don't have to do it in single weekend and get a week overall
* no prize probably
* stricter judging (only club members or people that made games can judge)
* Alu thought it would be cool for 2 game jams

* high interest in (online) game nights
* no plans yet

* high emphasis on member talks this year
* some incentive maybe?
* badge on riot maybe???
* $10 snack credit if in person???
* pins and stickers???
* to claim a spot just edit the spreadsheet, link is in the topic of officers

* no official dinners but maybe some unofficial sneaky ones
* lots of members miss dinners
* we got takeout and when to someones backyard over summar

* still have midterms and finals study parties somehow

* open to suggestions!
* still trying to keep club live and active

## Club Business
* waive $10 yearly fee for new members?
* this is not much of income flow for club
* this is a good idea
* new members only
* we voted to wave the fee for new members
* msp430 funding pipeline potentially broken
* cs2230 not using msp430 kits because of the online classes
* this could come back
* not as bad of a situation as we thought

## Vague, Large, and maybe too Ambitious plans for this semester
* door bot 2.0
* we have approval
* has to be invisible from outside
* use chat to open the door
* girrockss showed interest in leading this project
* constitution revision
* need to clarify some gray areas
* pview demo station (yes, we're still doing that!)
* got large amount of money from cs department to build a demo station for tours and to build interest in the cS department
* got 3 new gaming computers
* still on the hook for the station
* bought almost all components but the VR
