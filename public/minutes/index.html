free software talk by reznee
what is a computer it excecutes instructions, thats it
what is a program a set of instructions binary code &amp;amp; source code you can modify the source computer reads binary
control to control the computer you must control the programs
what is free free implies liberty freedom
free v proprietary if software is free you can control it if its proprietary you cannot
4 levels of freedom freedom to run freedom to inspect and modify source freedom to share software freedom to share a modified program 0 and 1 protect individual freedom while 2 and 3 give freedom to distribute free != open source free is owning and controlling and modifing wheras open source is the argument that opsn source is better since everyone can be modified non free software corrupts if you write non free software you control users inspires people to create malware malware software that hurts other people malware is not just makwar missing features the only thing open source worries about if free has a bug you can fix it if a software is not free you cannot fix anything
knowledge the crux of the free software movement the more people know the better they can be
gnu project started by richard stallman in 1984 wanted to make a free operating system
gnu inux gnu needed a kernal and linux was that kernal
not just the ok its everything that it runs on as well the internet is also a problem
intel managment engine its a chip in your cpu can read all memory, access network more privleged than any software its not free
kibreboot used to free boot firware/ ime its a distro of coreboot
practical considerations install gnu linux slowely replace non free servies you will have to have some sacrafices be an advocate for the free software movement

sebestain&amp;rsquo;s talk: persinal finance hes not your personal finance guy
why is it important? stuff costs money, fininaial freedom peace of mind prepardness career flexibility retirement (hopefully) best time to save money a long term setup
spend less than you make how much you save is just as important as how much you make have an income, stay in the black (positive income) you can measure where your life style can be having an income helps you build wealth
choose where your money goes: its resource allocation focus on needs and loves (food, housing, stuff you love) try cuting out wants create a budget if you can
invest your money you save retirement accounts: build assets to support your future self retirement accounts give you money compound interest time value of money (money now is better than money later) exponential growth long term consistancy (let your money grow for you)
avoid debt easuier to get yourself into debt than out emergency fund cash cushion for blind spots with 50000 dollars in debt with minimum payments you wouuld lose 19,000 dollars
good debt? bridge to a better life (student loans, mortgage, car loan) have a plan to pay them back

hackathon next weekend (03/26) is hackathon. it will be in the bernhard center west ballroom 8am-8pm (or thereabouts).
we would like to do class visits next week to promote hackathon. let alu know if you are available to do so and flyers will be provided.
the budget for hackathon will be submitted tonight so we can get money from wsa.
giving day giving day is on 04/12. people will be able to donate through rsos.
money talk we have two portions of money that the dean&amp;rsquo;s office owes us. giving day money from last year, and a reimbursement for science olympiad. the dean&amp;rsquo;s office was confused about science olympiad reimbursement receipts and would like to provide us purchasing power directly instead. the giving day money is sitting in a bank account run by the dean&amp;rsquo;s office, so we&amp;rsquo;ll need to contact them if we want to spend it.
we also owe $300 to the university library because they accepted a package for us. to settle this debt, our options are to transfer money through the wmu account or to write a paper check. kahrl gave a wonderful talk about how banks work, but the important part is that paying our debts through the university makes things much easier for us.
$500 would remain as dean&amp;rsquo;s office money after our debt is cleared. the wsa is expected to provide us money for renting the bernhard center for hackathon, but if not, we&amp;rsquo;ll pay through the dean&amp;rsquo;s office.

welcome back introduction of any new members one new member: hammer distancing plans for now, all meetings will be online
investigating a different platform than google meet to enable an &amp;ldquo;online club room&amp;rdquo; that people can just drop in to
google meet doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow this functionality
jitsi looks like a good alternative and is self-hosted
also complies with the accessibility standards set by the university
just need web browser to join meetings
access to club room fairly limited
kohrman is technically open mon-thurs 7:00am-9:30pm
still, please talk to an officer if you want to physically be there, there are limits to the amount of people that can be in a room
plan is to disinfect about once a month or so, but still clean up after yourself
girrockss picked up disinfectant and will be out for people to disinfect the areas you interacted with
requirements for using the club room: ask an officer first wear a mask if there is someone else in the room disinfect whatever you touch distance- this means multiple people can&amp;rsquo;t use a single part of the club room at once (elect. workbench etc) event plans career talk by kevin khaw
former highering manager at google
&amp;ldquo;an inside look into hiring at google&amp;rdquo;
either sept 24 or oct 1
thanks, alu for organizing this!
game jam soon (1-2 weeks from now probably)
new format
still 48 hours but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do it in single weekend and get a week overall
no prize probably
stricter judging (only club members or people that made games can judge)
alu thought it would be cool for 2 game jams
high interest in (online) game nights
no plans yet
high emphasis on member talks this year
some incentive maybe?
badge on riot maybe???
$10 snack credit if in person???
pins and stickers???
to claim a spot just edit the spreadsheet, link is in the topic of officers
no official dinners but maybe some unofficial sneaky ones
lots of members miss dinners
we got takeout and when to someones backyard over summar
still have midterms and finals study parties somehow
open to suggestions!
still trying to keep club live and active

advertisement for plan and club article for advertisement for this semester: business cards, fliers, table banners

we are going to to the banner printing resource on campus which will cost about $20 per table banner.
we will need fliers to post for plan that we can make ourselves that will cost about $10 for printing.
we vote to allocate the $40 to plan advertisment that will be handled by kami

linux library typo has ordered a large amount of 16gb flash drives for club.
the idea is that we can have ready to go bootable flash drive of many different distros of linux and other oss to assist with getting pcs ready for classes and other os related projects
the door swipe the positive factor of the door swipe would be allowing members to access club as freely as they please.
unfortunately this has great downsides such as losing autonomy in controlling room access(probably forever) to campus safety, cost of around $1000, and it would also be non transferable if for whatever reason the club was relocated.
those who were present at club voted to not get the door swipe access, but we did not feel that those present at club represent a majority of current club members so we will make google forms or other online ballot for those who did not attend to vote.
for now you can message in officer if the door is locked when you arrive. alternatively you can call the office phone by clicking here
spring book buy club is doing a book buy in the upcoming months.
if you have any books or other materials that would benefit you or the club with computer relate projects, please mention it in the officers room in the chat.

features of jazz are hosting 2230 and 3240 git servers and repective websites
wakko is a physical spot hosting yakko(production server or official cclub for business) and jazz
wakko will be an open stack controller node
jazz(r420lpoweredge) was originally
dot dots will likely require us to open ports
dot will be our new recreation server.
it will provide hosting for shells and vms
host shells for all member and will be a vm host.
it has been proposed that we allocate $300-400 to double ram for dot
thoughts what could we do to provide a similar first shell experience or cmd line experience? could we do it with riot or matrix along those line? setting ups some type of self hosted ctf breaking project?

for a general idea, spinx suggested a first task. we would program a robot to follow a line in a race competition.
question about yakko no on going investigation concerning anything with yakko.
jjohnson and club still have to talk about some specific issues.
for now, jason johnson has a sudo account to access yakko and he will have physical access to the system.
jason has already conceded that after he accesses the server he will give us a log of what he did.
the club would like a schedule of periodic checkins or at least some notice of before the check in with the server. result in later news.

3:00 pm, on a tuesday, c224 (parkview)
the general state of yakko and surronding affairs investigation has been closed(as far as dr. trenary knows)
jason johnson has a sudo account to access yakko. he has said he would like to do some type of periodic checkin in at his leisure
there has been no formal agreement made as far as when the server can be accessed.
relying soley on irc is not a viable option for the future.
club&amp;rsquo;s stance on allowing access by the cs department the computer deparment will have total access to club&amp;rsquo;s server log files
the club would like a schedule of periodic checkins or at least some notice of before the check in with the server.
jason has already conceded that after he accesses the server he will give us a log of what he did.
the log would be posted publicly for all memebers to see.
we would prefer access to the server to be physical instead of allowin grandom ssh access to the server.
any agreement should have at least some sort of email trail for our record.
the future of servers and accessibility yakko will become soley a production server.
jazz will be available for member use(via openstack)
ssh from yakko and jazz to wmu will be cut off.(possible exoanded to the tcp protocol)
member access to features vms will be limited to 1 x (1gb ram and 1 core) per member and available upon their own request.(some sort of web interface should be used that allows member to create there own vms )
many isos will be available(archlinux, debian, ubuntu, manjaro, etc..)
memeber&amp;rsquo;s home directories will be limited in space to 25gb as default
all directories outside of /home/ will be open to auditing(by use of auditd)
general comments about the servers and other issues openstack will allow vps through jazz.
there will be no torrent client on the server.
we can run a scrit that will allow us to scan for copyrighted information by extenstion type or file size(e.g. .mp3).
auditd will allow us to view the circumstances during which certain commands where used(e.g. ssh, yes)
preventing copyrighted materials from being on the server is the most sensitive issue for dr. carr
if multiple chats are being used for club purposes they need to have access to one another to prevent &amp;ldquo;dark corners&amp;rdquo; of activity.
no decision on what chat should be used has been reached.
any who thinks that yakko is secure needs to know that the cs deparment can gain root access at anytime to yakko.
any advanced paid membership can be refunded if requested.

yakko server status for the last two weeks, the computer club yakko server has not had access to western michigan university&amp;rsquo;s network. earlier today there was a meeting with jason johnson about the conditions needed for yakko to be re-added to the network. stringy, typo, sphinx, flay, hellbacon, and kami were our representatives at the meeting. there were some requirements set for the server to be reconnected to the network (these rules will apply to all servers in the computer science network). jason johnson will have a sudo account with all privileges. this condition has already been met and he now has a local sudo account. logging will be used on the server. due to missing logs at the time of the incident, we would need to make sure logging is working in order for the computer science department network to remain secure. a list of all sudoers on yakko with phone numbers and contact information will be supplied to jason johnson. this list will be required to always be up to date. this is to test for security on a weekly basis. a list of ports and services used by the server will be supplied. a formal document describing the requirements for this policy will be available soon. this policy will be given to us and to all other server owners on the computer science network in order for the department to keep their network secure. this policy was put in place to prevent any similar situations from happening in the future. the reason the investigation details were not known at first was because information could not be risked to be given to the person that was responsible for the server security issues. it is hopeful that very soon the server will be brought back online after all of these requests are properly met. we would like to thank the support of computer club members, dr. trenary, and dr. carr for helping us get through this situation. why the server was down as it turns out, the actions of giggles accidently caused yakko to be temporarily removed from the western michigan university network. it started when giggles was fired from his job at the geosciences department without being given a chance to transfer administrator accounts to his replacement on the 31st of march. in an attempt to resolve this issue, giggles accessed the geosciences servers through an established ssh connection from yakko to transfer information to college of arts and sciences technology services on the 2nd of april. due to an active directory administrator password being changed by geosciences, their entire file server was rendered inaccessible. the open ssh connection to yakko was noticed which led to a security emergency and oit contacted the computer science department to ask for yakko to be removed from the network on the 3rd of april. giggles had a meeting with the director of it at the college of arts and sciences and was told that two of the passwords he gave were incorrect due to them accidentally being swapped. giggles was then able to help them reaccess their file servers on april 5th. the oit investigation was extended because yakko was misconfigured and did not have logs at the time of the investigation. the full report written by giggles can be found at: https://gist.github.com/blakewrege/0da98dc1ed1b58efdbc47af820d48633. nominations before we started the nominations, kami has made a suggestion for the future officers to create an alumni ambassador position which could act as a mediator between alumni and students. president nominations: sgtsarcasm, kahrl, dolphin, cpg, and leech. vice president nominations: zurek, dolphin, mobyte, sgtsarcasm, leech, and hellbacon. treasurer nominations: tank, dolphin, twitch, mobyte, yillivs, and kharl. vp of finance nominations: leech and kahrl. secretary nominations: mobyte, hellbacon, and cookie. at next week&amp;rsquo;s meeting, the elections will be held. if you would like to submit an absentee vote, please try to contact a computer club officer through facebook, the backup irc server, or slack. each candidate will present a speech at the elections as usual and there will be a discussion before voting for each position. good luck to all of the nominees! meeting ends at 6:58 pm

plan preparation cpg is not going to be the vp of ops so we will need a group of people to work on plan. hardison will help us make a list of things to do that we will need to organize plan. the group of people that are going to help with plan will need to be able to make important decisions. people will need to be able to be committed if they want to help. we will need to organize plan far in advance so we will not need to worry about setting things up shortly before plan. since hardison won&amp;rsquo;t be here during plan, we will definitely need people to help out. sponsors should be a priority. we should have one person dedicated to sponsors. we should build our relationship with potential sponsors so we can get in contact with them quicker in the future. we will definitely need help from giggles to get the league of legends riot sponsorship. 501(c)(3) is a requirement for many businesses, but instead we may be able to obtain funds by putting them through the university. someone will need to rent out the rooms early at parkview. bigguy, our vp of finance, will be the person to help us get concessions. we should focus on getting a wide variety and enough of popular items, since leftover items will go to computer club. additionally, the webmaster will need to set up the website in advance so people can sign up. pre-registration on the website should go up about a month in advance. pre-registration gives us general attendance information, tournament interest information, mac addresses, and tournament team registration. posters should also go up early so people know about plan. an overwatch tournament is expected to bring in a lot more people. if we need any more information or if we have any questions, we can contact hardison. over the next couple weeks, we will be dividing the needed tasks for plan to multiple people. oculus rift computer our temporary machine for playing on the oculus rift is gone. we should buy a new gaming pc if we want to power the oculus rift. mobyte has put a pcpartpicker link in irc (http://pcpartpicker.com/list/yl8vvy), check it out and give feedback if you want to help us pick out the new computer for computer club. lockpicking demo jason johnson is giving a lockpicking demo this monday at 2pm. stringy will be there helping to teach high-schoolers about lockpicking. if anyone wants to help, let stringy know. minecraft server we&amp;rsquo;re playing minecraft on a server right now. if you want to join us, join the #minecraft channel on irc and join the ip in the topic. events nospace is thinking of shutting down the showcase saturday and coding challenge sunday events. it might be put on hold until the semester starts but nospace is trying to gauge interest. if you are still interested in these events, let him know. investment ray davidson may be interested in sponsoring computer club. he is coming to computer club july 28th. for more information, check the following links: http://www.nationalccdc.org/ http://www.meetup.com/zoosec-kalamazoo-michigan-infosec-meetup/ this event is on july 22nd.

oculus rift we are now considering to get the nvidia 1070 instead of the 970, so we will wait until that comes out. the price range should be somewhere between $800 and $1000. ohaimark&amp;rsquo;s offer still stands to sell us his computer. we should consider parts with good warranties, since our machines at computer club get a lot of usage. the machine will need at least 3 usb 3.0 ports and 1 usb 2.0 port. projects nospace has an idea to look at online courses of interest to club. nospace would like to get a computer club coursera or udemy account. if you are interested in this, let nospace know. we can pick out 2 or 3 courses, and then vote on which one to take for a week. hellbacon is redesigning the pos to be web based. it is using jquery and php for maintainability. some people have suggested using a framework instead of php. ldap support has also been suggested. it will possibly also have paypal support by using their api. we should also look at androidpay support. we are going to try to do at least one or two hackathons this summer. demorest wants to implement ranked voting to stringy&amp;rsquo;s existing voting program. ohaimark and tank are in progress of working on the mame cabinet. they should start work next week. they may need many hardware parts to replace and they will likely make a list for us. nospace has brought up his noise detector idea for putting a raspberry pi on the wall that can give alerts when the noise in the room is too loud. adafruit sells a sound level kit (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microphone-amplifier-breakout/measuring-sound-levels). cpg is working on a google calendar bot in go. we may be starting a new general bot with an emphasis on helping people learn how to create their own bots. python is the main idea for what we want to use. we will have a discussion about this in july. angular angular hackathon is starting tomorrow at 8pm.

first meeting of the 2015-2016 academic year! a welcome to our new members and a welcome back to our old ones! door we do not currently have a door bot, so the most reliable way to tell whether the room is occupied is with the $office command. if your computer&amp;rsquo;s mac address is registered with fish (one of our bots) and you are in the room, members on irc will see your nickname following the $office command. type $office -r [your mac address] into #geekboy and fish will register your computer. office hours officers of computer club are required to hold office hours in order to keep the room open for members that need help, or just want a place to hang out. office hours can be found on our office hours calendar or our events page. run $office in #geekboy if you would like to know what officers are in the room at any time. communities and schools last year, we sent some volunteers to the main street magnet school for a robotics workshop for students. contact sphinx, or send an email to emilydemorest@gmail.com if you are interested in volunteering this year. fall 2015 activities plan plan is our semiannual lan party that takes place at the parkview campus (college of engineering and applied science). fall plan 2015 will take place from november 7th through the 8th. talk to hardison, message him on irc, or join the #plan channel for more information. if you would like to help out, we are always looking for volunteers. ctf capture the flag events are cyber-security competitions that colleges or even high schools can participate in. the challenges involved range from software reverse-engineering puzzles to general trivia questions. people of every experience level are encouraged to join in, since there is always knowledge to absorb. the first ctf we will be participating in is the csaw ctf. join us between september 18th and 20th in the computer club room. bronco bash if you would like to help us with bronco bash, meet us in the computer club office at 1 pm on friday, september 11th. we will have table 216.

hey, everyone.
the ctf/ cyber-security talk had a great turnout and i&amp;rsquo;m very excited to see you guys tomorrow for csaw ctf 2014
csaw homepage: https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/
the ctf starts at 6 sept 19 (today), but we&amp;rsquo;ll be there way early getting prepped. just hop in channel and see who is in the room.
i&amp;rsquo;m planning on being there at 2pm or earlier.
for anyone who missed it, our esteemed member rocco niccosia aka funky was able hop on and give us a talk remotely from his new company in atl georgia (funky hinted they may be looking for interns soon)
want to get ready? for slides from funky&amp;rsquo;s talk
ctf for the dirty casual: click here http://rocco.io/ctf/#/
want to get an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be facing?
csaw challenges from last year: http://repo.shell-storm.org/ctf/codegate-2013/
if you have no clue what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, definitely check out some of these problems, then search google for writeups for those specific problems.
problems are often very similar between years. looking at last years ctf is an easy way to get ahead.
funfact when i searched, i came up with writeups from mandatory on the first page of results. http://thehackerblog.com/tag/csaw-2013-writeup/
/join #ctf in channel and collaborate with other new members.
remember, its fine not to know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. we&amp;rsquo;re here doing this to learn. this isn&amp;rsquo;t a spectator sport, so dive in ask questions and help where you can. these are problems. they&amp;rsquo;re hard and frustrating and rewarding as hell when we get them.
if we work together we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to beat this thing to death with a bag full of flashlights.
the bag is our bond. the flashlights are our ingenuity.
see you at 6!
&amp;ndash; flay

##meeting begins at 6:00pm##
david begins meeting
###computer club administration:###
david is stepping down as president. sphinx will be stepping up as interm president until next semesters elections. he will then appoint a president and things will go on as normal.
we still need to do nominations for fall, but we well allow time for people to settle in and consider who they would like to nominate.
flay is appointed as vice president by sphinx
robert (misclik) is appointed as treasurer by shpinx
typo will be taking minutes
officer hours will be posted soon
###website:###
we were complimented on our website, however our contact link did not bring up anything for a specific user.
we will update the google calendar w/ new office hours.
###capture the flag:###
ctf team came in 21st out of 300 last week at &amp;ldquo;ghost in the shell code.&amp;rdquo; great job ctf team!!
there are two upcoming ctf events:
hack im tomorrow at 1:30pm play for this will happen remotely sat/sun ctf match @ 3am /j #ctf to find out when people will be at cclub for this event. please don&amp;rsquo;t show up at 3am both events are jeopardy style for more info /j #ctf
###new yakko (server):### new server is currently online with a public ip.
johnson isn&amp;rsquo;t giving us much leeway, so if/when we put it into the server room it cannot run in tandem with the old one for long. copying files will need to take place relatively quickly, but can be done remotely.
raid was setup, but many drives were not working. may use club funds for storage.
###plan:###
no head person for plan, but many people are working on getting things setup. /j #plan
###ups:###
c0 brings up that we need to buy a ups to help prevent further downtime from yakko. many members are willing to put in funds. zug has available ups to use.
###msp430 kits:###
msp430 stuff will be coming in, if not by tomorrow, then by monday. sphinx will be in cclub friday or saturday.
/j #geekboy and inquire when sphinx will be working on them in order to help.
###t-shirts:### t-shirts, misclik has a design for the t-shirt.
###talks:#
flay will be giving a lockpicking talk next thursday

##meeting begins 6:00pm##
###bank account:###
get bank account straightened out misclik, sphinx, and trenary will be on the account elf will move off of account ###some new members###
austin, blake ###capture the flag### &amp;ldquo;ghost in the shell code&amp;rdquo; ctf starts tomorrow, starts 3:30pm friday and goes all weekend until sunday till 3:30pm. rocco, zachzor, flay and more people will be there.
###mailing list### mailing list has been running. many members have not been receiving e-mails. members who have not received should talk to sphinx or an officer to sort out e-mail addresses. bears wrote the script to get out our minutes via e-mail.
pm an officer to have your e-mail to the mailing list.
###cs2230 msp equipment/boards### 2230 msp equipment to be in by tuesday.
sell date: thursday.
only 30 kits to put together. if youd like to help sphinx, contact him on when to show up and help out.
###plan (parkview lan party)### we need a person to head up plan and be a major player for organization.
perhaps form a committee to work together contact typo for league rso e-mails. sphinx has some beta keys for strife to hand out for possible raffles talk to developers of strife to possibly play their game at plan hogan is willing to help out with plan, as are misclik and zug talk of pre-sign up for plan. ###new yakko (server)### new yakko needs to be worked on. we need a person to lead in the server installation, we already have a few people helping, but a lead would be helpful.
some things to do:
we need to get raid going perhaps have people work remotely on it run servers in parallel for initial setup possibly
if anybody knows anything about servers, please volunteer. if you would like to learn some, feel free to show up and watch. ###website### rocco is heading up the new ccowmu website. if anybody writes a blog post or something interesting, talk to rocco to having it linked on the new website. if you currently write or plan to, itd be great to link to it. we need to list office hours on website as well.
###other ideas### we need officers to have hours for this semester. we will figure out who will be officers and when they are available.
zug suggests ticketing system, for things we need to do or delegate etc.
###talks### new talks: flay intends to have a lockpick talk, if you have any ideas for cool talks or want to give one, make it known!
###accouncements### zug has announcement: it career day at fetzer center at 9am. can show up at 12pm. must rsvp beforehand. they are looking for programmers in addition to it admins. the companies are ibm, autoowners, quickenloan, kellogs, gordon food services, and more. feb 7th. you should already have an e-mail from western about this.
one last thing: sphinx went to the rso meeting at 7am. many engineering rsos are working on many things, while we don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show as of late. we&amp;rsquo;d like people to be more active and have projects to work on.
##official meeting ends at 6:16pm.###
dropshock begins his talk 6:16pm. talk is on sabotoge, proper technique and operations.

members present: rancor, zerg, ohnomrbill, butters, grg, cokezero, drc
drc taking minutes
ohnomrbill has brought in a form for application for an armature radio club license. we&amp;rsquo;re not sure if we trust ourselves to not break fcc rules (i.e. we are immature rather than armature). fcc rules don&amp;rsquo;t allow for anything fun (no encryption, etc, what&amp;rsquo;s the point?)
mame cabinet discussion - do we have enough drive space? probably, but butters would like more. we are going to document everything we do to make the system work, and turn it into a script to modify a stock/standard ubuntu 10.04 (lucid lynx) lts install. after we get the system built, zerg would like to get a cap kit for the monitor and repaint the cabinet. rancor would like to wait until after bronco bash to work on aesthetic changes of the machine.
plan - we should probably think about getting in touch with cotton about vlan scripts. what will be brought to parkview, do we need a truck? possibly we&amp;rsquo;ll bring a fridge and some candy. not anticipating a large turn out for the summer plan as they generally are not, and we have not been aggressively advertising.

drc ambles in soon after.
kyle has shaving problems but also has a fundraiser idea or something
he thinks the club should recycle used/old electronics, jewelry, etc. ecophone has a program where you print out shipping labels, send stuff in and receive a check.
includes receipts for tax exemption. we can also order promotional materials from their website. (a recycling pyramid scheme) if people drop off valuable equip. the club can keep it/resell it.
they take ink jet cartridges, cellphones, laptops, cellphone batteries, jewelry?, etc.
the school would possibly give the club money to operate this project (green initiative?).
sounds badass. that&amp;rsquo;d be sweet says butters.
let&amp;rsquo;s buy a tv. okay. now we need money. okay.
summer plan: june 19
advertising on website and a few forums, nothing big. profit: sell last plan t-shirts, charge for non-members (decision tba)
hackinac island! drc proposes spending a four day weekend hacking as much of mackinac island as possible. nice.
seems to be lots of interest among club members. alternatively, a group could go to hope.
hackinaw and hackinac domain names available!
butters passively aggresively tells everyone to stay on topic.
friendship village this weekend: cokezero and smerky?
jessie&amp;rsquo;s info on renting a mobile arcade for bronco bash. $200/day for rental from klassicarcade in gobels, michigan. need to check with bronco bash organizers to make sure we&amp;rsquo;ll have enough power/space.
possibly co-rent the arcade with red button. wsa could possibly give us money, especially if two rso&amp;rsquo;s are involved.
they also have two empty cabinets they would be willing to give us for free. black one in rough shape but with better specs/gray one is better shape without all the bling.
jessie emailed klassic arcade and requested the black cabinet and getting a tube. tubes approx. $80.
pinballatthezoo.com: april 16th and 17th, $10, play pinball all day
begin contacting possible sponsors: greg (balls!) kyle (danger den)
nominations for new officers: rancor and butters for president and also vice president. dylan for vp. cokezero for treasurer. scrabble for secretary. kneuts for president (declined).
think about nominations being done by secret ballot this year. drc can set up a phonotron voting system. voting will be april 15th.
long term goal: update constitution
keys and crap still seem to be a problem ^_^ and its really hot in here.
presentation tonight: tim with special guest butters

meeting started: 6:03pm
drc was already here when the meeting started. so surprising.
talk about friendship village. 2nd or 3rd week of april, cokezero and butters.
kyle requested censorship of the minutes to protect the identities of certain members activities on st. patricks day.
6:04 � butters calls whitehat with google voice. mentions that fonotron is racist and doesn�t like dealing with japanese numbers.
6:05 � talk of plan profits. no bill for cclub plan shirts yet, talking with studio to keep updated on information on billing and whatnot. cost is ~$260. looks like we �basically� broke even on plan costs/profit. 6:07 � smerky hands out leaking bawls. zerg shotguns one of them. lots of slurping sounds and possibly a stain or two on the floor. smerky finds the experience �unpleasant�
6:08 � 6:20 � back to plan talk. thoughts about an �after action� review on ways to improve for plan 14. earlier advertising. butters takes responsibility for failed advertising. could use better documentation of efforts planned or completed in case transfer of main plan planning duties needs to switch (i.e. lyth ragequiting) kyle volunteers to make nerd-scout cookies for next plan.
plan 14 planned date � september 25th.
info on broncobash will be posted in may, might require shift in plan date.
minimum of two months for initial contact with possible sponsors.
keep working list of plan sponsors.
july 30th for shirt designs due. smerky complains about frozen bawls.
possibly get sponsors to chip in on shirt costs, put their logo on the back.
6:20 � geekouts? ideas? next weekend, not this weekend (2 weeks after plan) start advertising, email kaminski. times? 11am - ?? on saturday. activity will be hack this site, in cclub offce
6:22 � uberyakko. yakko has uptime of 4 days, 6 days before that, 10 days before that�.. really need uberyakko up. getting things up (butters, drc, etc..) working on php/mysql/syncing home dirs, waiting on drc�s contributions to finish up initial requirements. finish by end of month? (ha!). betting started on when yakko will crash. general consensus of within 1 week.
6:30 - meeting closed.

meeting starts at 6:17pm.
senior design idea:
dr.trenary has a plot to rule the world. actual idea is for seniors with to integrate their projects with the computer club so that people can do things that they are interested in. projects would turn in to large scale possibly and possibly long term. this could bring good &amp;ldquo;bang&amp;rdquo; for the computer club. computer club would act as a client of the seniors who are doing the projects.
we should come up with a really good project so that the cs project will allow it for a senior design project.
possible software project to interact with class schedules. other idea is some sort of streaming application.
distribuated rendering idea for the project. it would be for rendering anything from home. rendering idea could ideally lead to a tesula cluster.
the new computer is in and it smells real nice.

possible purchases:
talking about possibly buying a computer. but it is being held off in case the bradford system goes into implementation. we also have about $1400. kyle said that he put together a good machine on newegg for $700. we may hold off on buying it if we need to by gigabyte switches.
if bradford system is implemented then we may have to do all the wiring for plan our selves. the cost figures for cabling would be $70 1000 foot spool of cat5e and $40 for 200 male connectors.
drc arrives at 6:38pm.
blah blah blah.
nothing seems to be going on at the moment.
meeting ends at 6:56pm.

if you still want to order a shirt you can get $10 to cameron or pay through paypal.
friendship village: no volunteers thus far, greg&amp;rsquo;s still
sudo: some users with sudo were using it to play pranks on other users and so lost their sudo privilege. as of now there are no sudo guidelines so we will be brainstorming and putting new rules into the constitution.
potential sudo guidelines: no unauthorized access without just cause
no pranks what-so-ever, respect other members
all software additions/removals must be made public (possibly creating a separate log file for installs)
no installing potentially harmful software
sudo access will be granted by president and vice president
if these guidelines are not followed sudo will be suspended until the situation is reviewed by president and vp
balloon project is still active, fyi.
purchase of a bulb for the projector has been authorized!
zerg&amp;rsquo;s presentation tomorrow 8:00pm in dunbar, studio a (in the basement). it&amp;rsquo;s about motion capture! it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be awesome! whitehat is gonna wear a skin tight suit!

saturday january, 14th
apparently scarlet isn&amp;rsquo;t actually a freshman anymore due to some sort of &amp;ldquo;credits&amp;rdquo;. you may still call him freshman but he would appreciate air quotes when using the term. this is entirely optional, however.
presentations:
january 22nd- vim presented by steffo
january 29th- phishing presented by whitehat
february 5th- motion capture presented by zerf
february 12th- intellectual property law presented by drc
february 19th- tcp/ip presented by lazer
february 26th- something by cowbar
march 19th- soft raid presented by cameron
plan- tentatively march, 28
team fortress ii
guitar hero
smash bros. brawl
left 4 dead
everyone loves the idea of a &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; plan (retro-plan, ye olde plan)
wass is okay.
cleaning party this saturday. there will be pizza. it will be around if you don&amp;rsquo;t come, you don&amp;rsquo;t get to keep your club key. we&amp;rsquo;re still looking into alternatives to this key problem. getting a doorknob with key pad is a possible option. building services are probably the people to talk to.
c-club getting in on an open source project, or starting up one of our own. such as, a blackboard application.

welcome back!
the building coordinator will not give us any more keys. jesse suggests we get a key safe to put on the door so every club member has access. club is unofficially allocating $20 to this project.
cameron is looking into getting a list of names who keys have been signed out to so we can track them down (there are over 12 out there!)
greg&amp;rsquo;s analogy: would you go to a friends house and, not understanding how a microwave works, stick a bunch of metal in it and run it for a couple hours? well, don&amp;rsquo;t do that thing to our server!
translation: don&amp;rsquo;t fork bomb the server on accident.
office cleaning
this must be done or we may lose our room! we should schedule a monthly cleaning date.
presentations finalized! jen refuses to make another list of possible presentation topics because she is forced to do this every week. please see previous minutes.
smidget-jan. 7th
greg makes a chart: who is not available on what days
mon-0
tue-10
wed-4
thur-10
fri- no one wants to come
splitting up meetings and presentations? bad idea- presentations would get no turn out, they&amp;rsquo;d be forgotten about
good idea- drink specials at bilbo&amp;rsquo;s
presentations are tentatively going to be scheduled on thursdays at 8:00pm. this avoids conflicts with professors we want to come who have classes, etc. next presentation is steffo&amp;rsquo;s vim presentation on jan. 22nd.
february 5th is photoshop or motion capture presented by zerg

plan
we made $388! more than usual, despite having a lower turn out. people who won tournaments will be able to come for free next plan.
idea: have a new (easier) tournament next time to encourage less hard-core gamers to enter or have a designated noob tournament
we definitely need more sponsors next time since we had no prizes! access points need to get up this week.
uber-yakko was supposed to be up by thanksgiving! what&amp;rsquo;s the deal? it&amp;rsquo;s not yet mounted properly
if anyone knows where &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; power supply goes, let cameron know.

tabs need to be paid before break. the limit for tabs is $5. don&amp;rsquo;t go over! cameron will come get you.
drc brought in an example of his tv-begone project kit if anyone wants to check it out. tis super cool. projects are costing $15 now, but the club is subsidizing the kits down $10. the proceeds will go to creating more project kits. drc made tv-begone and a programmer kits, he is super awesome. kyle loves him, but don&amp;rsquo;t we all.
whitehat is gonna pick up some more wire strippers for the club. conference idea
host a weekend conference sometime on a couple specific topics. we could re-present previous presentations, host a couple workshops, get trenary to come talk and maybe host a guest speaker. sometime in march or april possibly. conference ideas: computers
presentation ideas next semester
smidget will be presenting early january (on something)
cameron: raid presentation
drc: software laws (and conspiracy theories, i suspect)
whitehat: social engineering
whitehat&amp;rsquo;s brother: digital security or (he&amp;rsquo;s studying at ferris to join the fbi)
mr. macky the linear algebra teacher would like to present
dr. al fuqaha: something
lazer: tcp-ip
cowbar: dunno yet
shubot: history of computers
php, mysql, steganography, making beer, voip, evolution of internet
cameron knows where to shoot people to make them die.

private wow server is awesome and free. ccowmu.org/wow to get hooked up! only people allowed on server are people within two degrees of separation from computer club members. jen is the highest level on the server who got there legitimately, booya. how to regulate cheating and stimulate economy with so few players has yet to be determined. removing the level cap would be fantastic. spacey&amp;rsquo;s idea: make an instance based on the average group level.
friendship village
last saturday, 11/15, went well. next date to go is december 5th. you can still sign up to go and help out the old people.
t-shirts
shirts have not been ordered yet. stu will be ordering them asap.
are the access points on-line? we&amp;rsquo;re keeping three and selling the rest individually. hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll be sold for $100+.
lazer spilled two cans of pop on the floor. now we have to get the carpet cleaned, thanks lazer.
whitehat&amp;rsquo;s fundraiser idea: sell blood and semen (a.k.a. hacking darwinism) any real fundraiser ideas? prostitution, selling donuts, selling ethernet cables
mame cabinet update
we need money!
lazer found a 27` for $300
clean your crap off the work bench please! we need the room.
moving computer club meetings to a different day next semester:
discrete structures is thur. night so many members would have to miss the meetings. possibly moving to thursday at 5:30 (but would still conflict with presentations) or moving it to wednesday or friday night.
tentatively, computer club meetings will be wednesday at 6:00pm. plan is this saturday
cokezero and free admission for people who are volunteering at plan and half off for cclub members
$15 get you into the plan and membership in club
whitehat&amp;rsquo;s virus presentation is tonight.
smidget wants to do one when he&amp;rsquo;s in town at the beginning of january.

drc arrives: 6:15:30pm what a late bastard
spacey is writing minutes in place of the slacker secretary jen
studio - do we need someone to be an official secretary, or can we just force it upon unsuspecting noobs on a meeting by meeting basis?
response - well, unless we want to rewrite our constitution&amp;hellip; and we are kind of lazy, so no.
second order of business: friendship village
jen arrives: 6:17:30pm. i guess being married to the president conveys a slack sense of duty
we went to friendship village this past saturday for the intro trip, and we will need people for this saturday for another orientation. whitehat will go again, so will grg, dora will not be able to since she is going to kill bambi. we can always use more people. like last time, we will meet at the cclub office beforehand.
third order of business: plan x
sponsorship: edgetechcorp.com might sponsor the cclub in general, but we are attempting to convince them to sponsor plan x in addition. as payment we will put a link on our website for their site. we will get a discount on our purchases from them - more details will be coming soon. do we want to ask them for a set percentage off? thinking at least 25% off.
kyle will be printing up flyers for the plan x tomorrow. we should also chalk up the campus in addition, even though it is supposed to rain.
next order of business: presentations
whitehat&amp;rsquo;s presentation! computer virus!
crowbar is talking about something, but he&amp;rsquo;s quiet and no one is listening.
jade can possibly do one also.
we need more presentation ideas for the upcoming semester.
next order of business: project kits
need to clear off the work bench - in part, move uber yakko!
drc is talking of project kits, no idea what though. something about tv be gone kit ($15)
next order of business: uber yakko migration
crowbar - u-yakko done by thanksgiving. will replace dot and yakko (dot - irc, voip, opendpn server) web server on yakko again? if so, we are retarded. sys logs being sent to ed&amp;rsquo;s machine. rita is also going bad - possibly turning into a syslog server.
subtopic: trimming down the access to sudo. will also force better passwords for all yakko accounts. ideas for sudo trimming: keep it the way it is, pare it down to only officers/sysadmins, a tiered system (sudo to some things, but not others depending on role)
crowbar went back to his corner and keeps trying to talk about important things that we can&amp;rsquo;t hear.
nxt order of business: fund raisers
kyle&amp;rsquo;s idea is wondering if anyone else has ideas. so useful.
mel&amp;rsquo;s idea is a bake sale (cookies, cookies, etc)
cost: $3 per 2 batches. selling cookies for major profit (1000% profit margin. even the underwear gnomes didn&amp;rsquo;t have it this good)
added idea: also sell hot chocolate / coffee at this bake sale
next order of business: tie back to old order of business - rita. crowbar needs to learn how to project his voice.
next order of business: solicit some local guy for a presentation about games, cause we all love games.
these orders of business are getting short - we must want to leave
runt died, crowbar babbled, no one listened. something about replacing runt with old yakko when it&amp;rsquo;s pulled from parkview
we need a geekout - possibly this weekend after friendship village. ideas?
meeting adjourned - 6:49pm

tim swapped out the 120gig for a 200gig. the 200gig is missing, an investigation is to follow. now that he has split town, we suspect moving to new hampshire was a ruse to run off with a 200gig harddrive.

(cmu students, you may email us and we will prove your complaint.)
jim cotton should precipitate his knowledge to the world and whitehat is a snoop. i hope his wife never causes him to look over her shoulder, because he will probably complain. i like her a lot. thanks babe. mstaff brought the computer club a vga cable. what a nice guy. hey my frien&amp;rsquo;! would anyone like to do a presentation on php!? bash = drc. sea four considers &amp;ldquo;winging&amp;rdquo; his presentation and wishes for a &amp;ldquo;white thing&amp;rdquo; to be there. is someone going to advertise the presentations? we have a director of pr. in a world of spam, the computer club would like to participate, but we would like to not be spammed anymore. so stop it you montagues.
we would like to become defcon miniatures. firewire is so much better than usb. www.apple.com ==&amp;gt; please sponsor us. as cameron considers speaking, the misses enters the room and hinders that idea. laughter fills the room as he considers running away. dell is threatening to sponsor us. note to apple inc.: we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind an academic sponsorship, nor would we mind testing any of the equipment/ideas/etc. that you would like to invest in. cisco is way better in networking than iptables or anything linkux. greg complains about talking about important stuff. then we realize we are the computer club.
red octane would like to contribute? that would be fun. contact us. someone is donating servers? rancor is not using his xp box or something because he cannot overclock his usb ports anymore than they already are. whitehat sits silently waiting for a nudge from his wife to go mow the lawn. we need help &amp;ldquo;flyering.&amp;rdquo; we need help advertising and /etc/init.d. someone suggests calling up the pr director. i would like to eat some pizza and some pumpkin ale. meeting adjourned: 19:00!

allocating $48.63 to cameron for reimbursement for the party. dan donated a whiteboard, thank you dan.
greg is also going to donate one, thanks greg.
horton offered to find a low end router for us, thank you horton.
plan b:
date: ? some time in summer 2 schedule for presentations, geekouts.
greg is building a projector, should we move the screen? people seem to like that idea. ed is scared to look above the ceiling. this would be a cool geekout project. bronco bash:
we still have our tent, need a location near a building so we can plug our stuff in. we should probably figure out where it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. construction will probably mean it&amp;rsquo;ll be in the same place as last year. we need some new stuff to show off, like t-shirts. dan says bronco bash would be a good way to pimp tech week. tech week: tim suggests one major speaker. we need to find a way to appeal to the public. tim volunteered to take charge of the whole deal. dan suggested trying to hook people with presentations. the office needs to be cleaned again, despite the fantastic job drc did last time. rebuilding library. some of the books are old, but not old enough to be humorous. should we get new books? not sendmail, that would break our shelf. dan wants us to have club toys, like a wii. asterisk account would be cool, we&amp;rsquo;ll actually try to get that done asap.
we want to be better buddies with the cs department, apparently they like us too. it was mentioned that almost all of c208&amp;rsquo;s staff are our agents. we could recruit new agents out of c208 we need an officer meeting to schedule and organize stuff. tenatively scheduled for 6/09 meeting ajourned: ent6:30

the black box
what do we do with that thing? what is it&amp;rsquo;s status? it has an os, but nothing configured. we are going to use it as a communications device, with vpn, the asterisk server, and the irc server. rita is currently registered with oit, so we can&amp;rsquo;t yet re-register it until it gets deleted at the end of the semester.
a discussion ensued about how dns worked and how to get rita registered.
also discussed was the firewall configuration and why we don&amp;rsquo;t have yakko in the office anymore. tim suggested that we move the black box over to the machine room and configure it from there.
eric proposed that we do a barbecue, using the left over burgers, fries and hot dogs from a previous plan. cameron offered his house in battle creek for a barbecue. cameron suggested the weekend after finals, but a few people objected due to moving. we are looking at friday on finals week.
telephone issues
drc wants to to retire the waxyfat number for the cclub. drc tells us that he knows of a company that can provide an 800 number for $2.50/month and $25 setup fee. $0.02/minute incoming/outgoing. a local number is $5/month and 1/2 cent/minute for incoming/outgoing. this is through nufone. we would also have unlimited incoming channels.
drc proposed that we vote on getting a telephone number for the cclub. we can choose a vanity number for $25.
we will put the action in for review pending consideration of our finances. drc suggested that we can do a prepaid scheme. motion tabled until the next meeting.
the cclub has a wiki

plan 6:
plan advertisements stamped with approval
cs source community will match a $100 contribution made by the cc (currently $100, and if cc shells out an extra 100 raising the total to $200, they contribute $100 making it $300)

plan 5:
brian is thinking of having a one day lan 12pm-4am
tacos.
more tacos.
needless rambling, idividuals are going on about their classes.
yakko has been updated. (updated hard ware, etc.)
joe w. wants the firewall swapped already so we can get a vpn to the office up.
the computer club office now has 2 machines. one machine is a nat firewall, the other machine is designated for more pratical uses.
the nat has dual displays and processors. the pratical machine contains a geforece 4mx 420, and has a sound card routed into an old stereo with house speakers on shelves.
this was done to promote use of the office, and make the office a more comfortable environment for office hours.
soon we&amp;rsquo;d like to nat the office to yakko so we can have share mounted remotely using nfs.

new user creation script needed
we need a script that will do the following, not necessarily needed over the web.
it needs to do the following:
-create user
-set the home directory
&amp;ndash;date = /home/(sum, fal, win)(year)/(name)
-expiration
-password
-home dir/web dir owner ship/chmod.
-group
-automatic blog creator? see below.
-mail the &amp;rsquo;new-user&amp;rsquo; e-mail to the users supplied e-mail address (not yakko).
joe g. is creating a website &amp;ldquo;planet yakko&amp;rdquo; for individuals who don&amp;rsquo;t already have webblogs.
his invision is to have blog applications for all of the users.
the planet site should &amp;lsquo;aggregate&amp;rsquo; the blogs to create a central site for blogs.
brian has schedules for the tournaments for the plan.
this can be found hopefully on www.whatistheplan.com
widr was down yesterday, because joe w. turned the master volume up. there is no understanding of why this has happened, however if left the way it is now, noone should have need to touch it. phorce p managed to repair it.
joe w. wants to know what kind of local sponsorship we should have.
supposedly bust buy.
it appears no students showed for the meeting tonight, looks like we are calling it a night.
we hope the times will be the same, or longer, since the night time is more appealling to individuals.
hoping for:
9-1 sat. 8-12 sun.

start time: 7:14pm 1) plan a:
brian is having issues with bawls as a sponsorship, brian is currently awaiting an email to explain the situation. brian tried for sponsorship and they accepted, however had the incorrect date. he asked for this to be corrected and the sponsorship was removed. he went to reapply and was declined.
the other sponsors have not returned our call. our next order of business is advertising. we still need to get the port numbers for the other room. should we reserve the room to check all of the ports and make sure that the ports are in the script. however gamerz stuff is sending a mouse pad.
brian needs to receive the new port numbers from jim cotton. brian wishes to go out a night early to check the ports. if this happens they will need to have jim cotton run the port scripts before the night they check them.
there is still no word on making the boxheads site viewable by wmu students on campus.
the will need to pick up a machine that is already configured for dhcp and firewalling from matt if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up before the lan and if they cannot brian has suggested they could use a machine in the labs that are used for the networking classes.
other options are nick could come down with his machine.
matt called eric during the meeting and proclaimed he will be able to come down and bring the server.
eric proclaims the lan party planning is going smoothly, jim cottons phone number has been added to geekboys database by tim.
the computer club will be purchasing a chest freezer for the lan and for other events. cost: $140 it was voted by all if favor to do so.
the chest freezer will be left in the computer club and may contain ice cream for purchase during the year.
7:34pm - chris arrives
2) ham radio class:
status of the rooms is still uncertain.
tim stated he&amp;rsquo;ll check on the rooms.
eric drew a map to show tim where the room he needs to go is.
we need to fax a purchasing order to amazon for the books. it needs to include the promise that we were offered a discount for the books. tim questioned where to have the books sent. tim suggested the cs office.
committed: eric, tim, brian, joe w., chris, matt l., and an annonymous individual who e-mailed tim.
miles would if someone purchases the book for him.

there was discussion of adding photos to the whatistheplan website from previous plans. eric promised to send brian photos. chris asked about pre-register for the lan party on the whatistheplan website. eric asked how we are doing the multiple-day thing. we will probably use nametags and ask the plan participants to bring them.
4) total divergence

plan a
we need to be posted on psychorage. we need to post on yakko. we need to do a second run of fliers with date and location. planning seems to be going well. we are going to do setup on friday. matt won&amp;rsquo;t be coming, but will let us have the dhcp/firewall. we need to go into the other room to get the info to vlan that room. setup and testing will take place on friday night. saturday morning we start food setup. we&amp;rsquo;ll bring pop and other stuff on friday. we need more bawls. we need extra coolers. eric predicts that things should go smoothly. hopefully, the two-day thing will work out. we need to develop guidelines for what games will be played. we don&amp;rsquo;t want excess structure. security should be ok for overnight stays, since we should have sufficient security with the building doors and the room doors being locked. we need to bring long and heavy-duty extension cords.
melissa discussed some ideas for new food, including specialty coffees. joe expressed reservations about the idea. we need volunteers for the food stand. we need at least three people so that we can schedule breaks. we will have bagels and donuts in the morning.
ham radio class
tim reports that a room needs to be reserved for the six days. the days are june 28th, july 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th and august 2nd.
eric knows of which room we should ask for, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know the number of the room. brian can probably take care of the room reservation. once that is set, we will make the fliers for plan a and the ham radio class.
we will need to build a ham registration page. the arrl discount is 25% for 12. the regular cost is $20. amazon has many used books. tim asked for permission to purchase from the arrl web site. eric believes we will be able to sell all 12.
webmaster
the webmaster (joe w.) just got root access today. the web page is really out of date.

brian attempted to reserve lan rooms
still need to follow up. we have some flyers at http://www.whatistheplan.com/flyers. we want to post flyers earlier than usual in order to get more interest built up. we&amp;rsquo;ll also advertise online.
we are trying to reserve from friday to sunday on that week. it will be a multi-day event. we need to get into the other room to get the port numbers for the reservation of the other script. we are have interest in an xbox room.
ham radio class
tim reports that mr. john tucker has suggested that he is willing to teach the class. he wants at least 5 people in order to make it worthwhile. he is a programmer at wmu and a part time kvcc instructor. he recommends tuesday or thursday at 6:00 pm. he believes that we can do this in 5 to 6 weeks. we also have interest from a mr. shane feek, who is an instructor at glen oaks community college. mr. tucker will not be able to afford the time to do winter semester.
we will need a reservation for a room with the appropriate equipment. we will need to get the books, although students could buy it themselves if they choose. chris tells us that we can get a discount on &amp;ldquo;now you&amp;rsquo;re talking&amp;rdquo; of 25% on 12 or more. we have at least five members interested in doing the class, so we have our class. we will have to advertise. we also have to decide whether to do the class at parkview or main. eric recommends parkview.
vpn (tabled last week)
our office is not vlaned in such a way as yakko can be in our office. the question is, do we want to get with oit and get a new ip address under oit or do we wait for oit or do vpn ourselves. yakko is on the cs dept dns. we really need to get yakko in our room so that we have physical access to yakko. we should contact oit and try to get yakko into our own office. eric will try to contact jim cotton or bob trenary by email and diplomatically try to resolve the issue.
we will then need to deal with the cooling issue. we might need to contact someone in the environmental services. we might need to have some cool air pumped in, or at least turning off the heat to that room. tim suggested we might want to put the servers in the other room. lan party and fundraising
lan party costs were discussed for the new plan. $20 for the three days. we need some new games and events. the xbox rooms will be a new thing. other games would be nice, but it&amp;rsquo;s not likely to be organized like &amp;ldquo;this game here at this time.&amp;quot; mech warrior might be another game to consider, since it&amp;rsquo;s not being played as often. adjourned at 8:10 pm.

we should work closer to boxheads. the boxheads website is blocked from campus. we don&amp;rsquo;t know why. in the future, we will need to write down port numbers so that we can get the vlan script updated, especially if we add more rooms.
also important, we need to remember to write down the number of the telecom closet it goes into. complaints registered were against the size of the desk. people wanted it on the first floor. the gigabit hookups are in the classrooms. 88 seats, 44 places if a person uses the whole desk.
matt inquired about larger rooms. moving to rooms on main campus is unlikely. parkview is the largest room available. bernhard would cost money and we would need to rent tables, bring network equipment and deal with electricity.
it&amp;rsquo;s cramped, but it works. we don&amp;rsquo;t have the funds to expand it. alliance with boxheads was discussed. also, the concessions would not work, since bernhard has exclusive rights. we could expand to multiple rooms. we should also let people know that they can have the whole table to themselves.
summer would be better for a lan party. money issues would also be an issue with alliances. we&amp;rsquo;re also cheaper than most other lans.
we need dates for specific sponsorships. june 18th or 25th is proposed. 25th is after summer i session. 18th is before finals. advertising has to be very different, since we will have even fewer students. in summer, we will scale back food. summer will be more laid back. no prize tournaments without sponsorships. we need to really professionalize the site.
we also have a list of places to get sponsorships. are we interested in partnering with boxheads? we need to clarify that first in regards to blocking the site first. maybe fall.

plan
we need to be there friday to take inventory and test all ports for function. who is going to be there? joe, brian and eric are committed. it&amp;rsquo;s at 7:00 pm. we will arrive at 8:00 am. problem: we still haven&amp;rsquo;t confirmed with jim cotton. if that vlan script doesn&amp;rsquo;t run, we will have major issues. joe will continue trying to contact him.
we need the key from john kapenga. joe will try to get it tomorrow.
on the topic of prizes: no one contacted us regarding sponsorship. matt r. reports that digilink will be there with some stuff to set up a table.
prizes: $50-1st place, $25-2nd place, $10-3rd place, $25-door prize
most other lans cost more because they have to pay for the room and they have to bring their own network stuff. who has a car and time to get the przes? we will need $75 for bawls, according to brian. eric fetches the cash box.
we need coolers. matt r. offers his cooler for pop. eric offers to get the best buy prizes, but joe w. agrees to do it, since he lives close to best buy.
brian has begun configuring the servers. brian suggests that we set the servers up in the room on friday, rather than wait until saturday.
disbursements: eric $50 for food, craig $75 for bawls, joe w. $110 for prizes.
presentation next week
chris will give a presentation on cracking the web.
adjourned at 6:42 pm.

1&amp;gt; lan stuff
not able to get the other room, but we still have d205-207. jim cotton has been contacted. melissa and eric have again agreed to provide food, but are scaling it back this time. flyer posting has begun. brian recruited some folks to post. we got the flyers approved. prizes were discussed. last time, we had $50 gift cert. and $25 for second place and a $50 door prize. they were best buy gcs. do this again? server machines and games were also discussed. machines from parkview are available. last time, the tournaments were a bit chaotic. matt advises us to advertise the prizes early in order to attract vistors. eric recommends $50, 25 and 10 for third prize. joe recommends we wait until next thursday before we decide on prizes. brian suggested that we set a top limit budget for prizes. eric suggests we not specify exact prizes but just talk about how much total. over $100 in prizes.
game limitations were also discussed. brian asked if the game was running too long. eric suggested double-elimination, one-on-one. 10 reservations since the site started yesterday. parkview display screen should be updated. psychorage should also be updated, as should broncoweb.
cotton still has the vlan scripts.
the xbox lan thing is not going to happen. joe w. suggests that some people already expect an xbox lan game. so we may let them run those games if they wish. the people who know about it can play, but we won&amp;rsquo;t advertise. we can leave xbox lanning for plan 4.
2&amp;gt; inventory for lan rooms
joe told john that we will do it on friday night. we have to verify that the vlan and dhcp will be done, then we record any broken equipment so that we don&amp;rsquo;t get blamed for broken things.
will we have a summer lan party? joe will not be here, but some will. general discussion ensued on whether we want a lan party in summer.
3&amp;gt; what should the cclub do to increase membership
brian leads the discussion. brian summarizes the general ideas. discussions centered around electrical engineering and some more (ahem!) shady stuff.
eric recommends that we try to recruit younger students. we need to have officer candidates. tim asks how we advertise? joe points out that, despite putting up flyers, people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be interested. brian suggests hat we expand our technology presentations to things not covered by classes.
eric points out that we only advertise at parkview. we don&amp;rsquo;t advertise outside of this area. brian volunteers to distribute flyers around main campus.
eric reminds us that we got our presentation schedule set for the semester in advance. we had a lot more support from faculty. some professors would mention our presentations. most students don&amp;rsquo;t use their cs email now, so sending email is more likely pointless.
brian suggests a topic on nintendo mods might be more interesting. should the meetings be moved to parkview?

gratitude to tim, tim&amp;rsquo;s dad, isaac, chris and joe for the work in the office.
the office now has shelf space and it looks really nice. some books, sadly, were thrown out. so we do know how to sacrifice. several &amp;lsquo;70&amp;rsquo;s area theses hit the trash.
the lan party rooms are officially reserved. we need ports for the room for vlaning on the day. we will also need the ports for the spillover space. we will need to have computer club staff in the spillover room if we need it.
in addition to the three rooms with the breakaway walls, we will have the overflow room now. a question was asked about using a computer for announcements. the subject was debated. having an xbox area in the overflow room was also discussed.
joe, tim and bryan will have designs for the flyers and bryan will work on the web site, whatistheplan.com.
joe will spam all of the people who came to the last lan party. matthew will post on psychorage about it.
joe will also advertise it on the broncoweb.
joe is going to get the key to the display case.
we want to put up a display about our presentations.
chris brought up a topic touched on last week about a general chat session
meetings have become club-business oriented affair. advertising was discussed. tim asked how we advertise. joe responds that we put up flyers about our presentations. various recruitment ideas were discussed. a vote was taken for something, but the secretary has no idea what was voted on. we&amp;rsquo;re going to have a geek social next week.

members present: tim, isaac, bob, milo, ed, joe w. and eric
mail
problem occurred between oit, cs and yakko. ed fixed. mail from cs is working now as well. sendmail was doing strange things. mail was going in and coming out, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know where it was going. mail loops are not good! hal now knows how to deliver mail to yakko.
webpages
apparently, ssl is working, but there is more to do with the ssl aliases which were not ported from the old yakko. ed is trying to organize it all.
wakko
wakko is still working. we&amp;rsquo;re amazed by it&amp;rsquo;s uptime. the stream was broken for a short time, but it&amp;rsquo;s ok now.
shelving
tim&amp;rsquo;s father came and made suggestions for the office. his suggestions emphasized l brackets, shelves, 2x4s and other scary construction-like terminology. mr. miley thinks that it would cost about $100.
are we doing it this weekend? who&amp;rsquo;s going to be there? tim, chris, isaac, joe and tim&amp;rsquo;s father (maybe).
lan party
new members were filled in on our lan party. we have whatistheplan.com reserved. so we&amp;rsquo;re going to have a real website this time. we should devote next week&amp;rsquo;s meeting to plan planning. possible sponsorship was discussed. joe w. might know someone who might be a sponsor. what role the sponsor would take was discussed. it would be worthwhile to have some sponsor, even if only to offer their presence.
isaac and joe w. discussed the operation of the marmalade dog lan that they had at marmalade dog 5. last lan party at parkview saw some power problems, probably associated with our food vending operations.
melissa and eric will need help with food vending due to prior commitments.
php
joe suggests that we advertise that we have php4, since wmu doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer that service on their web server.
joe w. wants to start a publication for gamers
joe says that his company is interested in starting this publication and was asking if anyone had interest in writing articles for such a publication.
system backups
we will need to back up yakko at some time in the future. joe indicated that we would have to take yakko down. tim asks if the problem with yakko hanging on shutdown was resolved. joe said no. do we need install parties?
general agreement is that install parties are unnecessary thanks to the scst over at parkview.

the new yakko server
the server is serving. joe commends us for a fantastic job. we migrated in 3 days and we&amp;rsquo;re back to 90%. we still need to fix mail. it was working, but now it&amp;rsquo;s stopped. we can send mail and transmit/receive within the univ.
joe suggests that we have poed the oit department and must talk to them. joe will talk to oit tomorrow, if it is not found to be a configuration problem.
thanks to tim, chris, joe, isaac, matt and chad for their help with the changeover.
microwave
some suggested throwing it away, but others want to put things in it that should not be put into a microwave and fire it up to see what happens.
presentations
ideas are a basic unix presentation, mono, beagle, linux maintenance. eric will do the linux maintenance with package manager presentation next week.
various ideas for more presentations are discussed. joe offered to do a presentation on mono. penguicon was discussed. joe agreed to create a flyer tomorrow.
asp.net was also a suggested presentation.
new firewall
brain is dying slowly. we need to get that poor thing upgraded. we have a box that we can use.
new machine
we could use the old one as a backup yakko or offload the mail and web services onto it.
treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report
ed was scolded for not going to the bank. ed says we have $1300 in the bank and $300 to go to deposit. we still need to pay off our telephone bill from when we had a telephone.
tim and chris suggested that we get a voip phone. joe agrees. widr was discussed
the widr changeover went very well, thanks to isaac.

our microwave didn&amp;rsquo;t vanish
anyone need an old, heavy radioactive microwave? also, other junk needs to disappear. joe wanted the lamp to disappear, but was outvoted.
we have temporary shelving.
joe developed a temporary solution to the problem of lack of shelving by using our problem of too many worthless books to our advantage. webpage needs updating
tim was reminded that he agreed to be the new webmaster. tim vigorously denied ever saying such a thing. a few complaints were registered about non-functional mysql server and needs for more current updating.
update on requesting rooms for lan party
not done, since joe has been very busy. joe will attend to it by next thursday. scout&amp;rsquo;s honor! tentative date is january 26th.
and now for the bad news: yakko experienced a security &amp;ldquo;incident.&amp;quot;
yakko is still at redhat 7.3 and we need to update our system and do some clean up. the new yakko is currently in joe&amp;rsquo;s house. joe has set up kerberos and ldap and has transferred accounts. discussion involves tripwire. eric says that the configuration of tripwire is a pain. it must be configured manually. joe says it would be a project for an interested individual, but it might not be best to make that a group project.
debian is the choice for the new os. discussion ensued about matt&amp;rsquo;s customization script for storing log files so that we might find out what, if anything, happened. meeting degenerated into a discussion between users on the irc channel giving advise about the situation and people present at the meeting. the decision was made to shut down yakko at that time and deal with the new system on the weekend.

thanks to tim and joe for unteryakko. joe and tim installed a new machine under the debian os. it&amp;rsquo;s accessible via gasiorek.homelinux.com. to gain access, contact joe. isaac and joe purchased some material. isaac and joe were paid.
renewal checks have been received from several members. accounts have been updated for these members.
the individual running the pci graduate profile project contacted joe. this is regarding a new list that joe has been setting up for their group. issues were resolved regarding adding users to the list. mailman&amp;rsquo;s configuration options were causing problems, and joe discovered that mailman&amp;rsquo;s configuration options don&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
what is the cost for this service? we need to look up the cost of this service that we charged last time. isaac believes that it was $15. joe thinks we should encourage list members to get yakko accounts for their email.
another lan party? idea for may 5th, 2005 (05/05/05) for plan 3. what video games? isaac suggests unreal tournament. someone else has to talk to the dean and kapenga, since eric is no longer a student. we might need an extra room. maudlin suggestions were made which the secretary is not interested in transcribing. the date was shot down, since it&amp;rsquo;s not in the winter semester. march 26th was suggested and agreed to. d204-206 is the recommended rooms. ed agreed to contact kapenga about reserving the room. eric suggested another room which faces the dean&amp;rsquo;s office which is probably room d208. we will need the port numbers for configuration of the vlan. office things we&amp;rsquo;re getting rid of the microwave. tim talked to his father about help designing the shelves.
adjourned at 6:49. the roadhouse awaits us.

the computer club is now antibacterial. it is a way to automatically re-register us rather than having to file with the ocl every year. tim suggests that we do another chicago trip.
we stopped going years ago and perhaps we could resume our trips. perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea, but joe voiced concerns about the possibility of bad weather.
meeting degenerated into useless banter. isaac suggested that we fix the connection on the dosaweb server so that computer club doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a broken link.
it kind of looks bad.
status of widr
isaac informed us that he contacted widr and advised them that moving their web pages to our machine would not be a good idea, but we have no objections to keeping the widr stream in their office.
meeting adjourned at 6:48 p.m.

1&amp;gt; lan party went well.
exact counts not available, but we took in about $200 net.
do we want to do it again? yes. we want to have jan 29th as a tentative date. bryan and eric started advertisement. issues to address in the future: power for the food stand. apparently we had electricity issues. also, the tournament took too long. people showed appreciation and generally the group agreed that it was successful. people also appreciated that they could play what they wanted to. the motivation is to get people playing on one giant game.
next time, we might need to check out more rooms as spillover. we&amp;rsquo;re relatively close to the limits of the room. pricing issues? most of the foods were fairly cheap. our $5 is a great attraction. did most pay at door? 10-15 showed up and paid at door. isaac suggests we lower price of pop. balls did pretty well. we had three cases. one case remains. it was a really good seller. $1.50/bottle was the price.
the vegetarian food didn&amp;rsquo;t sell. the quesadillas didn&amp;rsquo;t move. we may keep the boca burgers. the chili and cheese didn&amp;rsquo;t move too well and it was a lot of hassle. nachos didn&amp;rsquo;t sell at first lan party. mozzarella sticks were good seller, as were burgers and hot dogs. pizzas did ok. 2&amp;gt; do we want more presentations?
we have requests for a wireless presentation in linux and how to use ndis wrapper when necessary.
we have only two weeks remaining. joe suggests that we don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to put together a presentation. eric volunteered to do a presentation on ndis wrappers and wireless.
another presentation on c++ review was scheduled for dec. 2nd.
3&amp;gt; suggestion to get a vpn into the office so we can bring machines into the office.
the vpn machine would be located here so we can run the traffic from the office into the machines at the parkview building. we would need to do research on how to connect through vpn. tim suggested he would research it over thanksgiving break.
matt suggested that we should talk to trenary about whether he could prod oit. matt wants to know why it would take so long. general discussion ensued about security, networks, etc.
matt suggests that we might want to research vpn and also prod cotton at the same time. have trenary talk to jim cotton.
4&amp;gt; we need people with architectural skills.
we really need shelves but we don&amp;rsquo;t have the experience to build one.
matt offers ambitious ideas about how we should build a deck and make the office a two story structure. we took turns trying to shoot the idea down.
we offered chris pruden beer, gas money, etc, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested.

members present: eric, joe, tim, brian, miles
1&amp;gt; the radio was reset
widr stream had static.
2&amp;gt; eric was slapped for mentioning gentoo.
update requests were made for php to be upgraded to the newest version. the general consensus was that it&amp;rsquo;s not doable at this time.
3&amp;gt; lan party
tournaments will be for doom 3 and ut2k4. 16 player double elimination. it will be tight, so we will need dedicated servers to be running the whole time. prizes will include $50 gift cards for best buy. it might be crazy due to the time constraints. brian has developed a time structure. joe asks for a copy of the schedule.
brian would like to offer a intranet site for people to register their teams.
tim, brian and eric made flyers. the flyers were submitted to osl. they have a stupid 24 hour rule, so it will be available at noon. we will meet in the office at 2:00 on friday. tim, joe and brian are going to meet in the office.
also, we are on the broncoweb and psycho rage. we need to post a map on yakko for off campus people and those who may not be familiar with the parkview campus.
4&amp;gt; sighs of relief were heard when chris arrived.

the computer club wishes to congratulate club alumni chad and melissa gross on the birth of henry james gross at 5:04 pm on 10/19/04. discussion of the widr stream
it&amp;rsquo;s still working, apparently. isaac explained how the stream works.
spread firefox is taking out a full page ad in the ny times to promote the 1.0 release. they are taking donations and they put your name in readable font on the ad. they have 4,000 donors. $10/name for student. $30/regular. the cost of the organization name is more.
there is a party in kalamazoo on the 20th of november. joe recommended bell&amp;rsquo;s for the firefox rollout week. joe will keep us posted.
lan party is a go. we need posters. november 6th. administrative stuff is set. emailing reminder to jim cotton and we want to arrange a vlan test. we need a flyer asap. tim offers to help. we know the rules for posting. inside residence halls is controlled by res. life. buildings are controlled by osl. buildings may also have their own policies. we need to get them approved.
advertising needs to be done on psycho rage, bronco web. tim suggests we advertise on educable office for the dorm advertisements and the dean&amp;rsquo;s office for the big displays at parkview.
official instructions will be to pull up to the front to unload equipment, then go to the back to park. we need to remind them to unlock the doors in november. the computer only keeps info for one month. we found out that when you create a new account on yakko, you have to create the home directory.

1&amp;gt; dot was down for a few hours. we&amp;rsquo;re blaming one of those ece guys for pulling the plug or something. anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s plugged in now.
2&amp;gt; we really need keys to this building
eric also needs help with the office.
3&amp;gt; presentation switcheroo
tim bailed out due to excessive studying. chris offered to do a voip-asterisk. eric offered to do gtk programming. other topics were suggested. if you would like to present on something, send email on officers.
4&amp;gt; lan party - nov. 6th at parkview campus
room is reserved from friday to saturday midnight. $5 preregister, $10 at door. we haven&amp;rsquo;t officially got permission from the dean, yet, but john is covering that.
when should we start advertising? permission is a prerequisite. we&amp;rsquo;ll have to do a detailed inventory, so they can&amp;rsquo;t accuse us of breaking stuff. apparently, this was a problem with the last lan party, even though what they accused us of breaking was noticed a week after the party.
5&amp;gt; widr is po&amp;rsquo;ed about the widr stream.
we can&amp;rsquo;t really do anything about the vlan situation, but some discussion was made about feeding the stream to a machine in parkview from a machine in the office.

members present: isaac, tim, ed, eric, joe, brian.
we plugged in wakko. it worked, but we&amp;rsquo;re still not vlaned. widr reception was tested and found to be somewhat lacking. joe complained about the lack of space in the office.
eric suggested that we put a notice in the glances in the western herald.
ed revealed his fascination with cron jobs.
yakko uptime: complaints?
the only issue was the uptime of the university and cs nets.
eric began discussing the construction project for this weekend.
eric would like some help on saturday afternoon and sunday. brian is a tentative yes. we want to have a shelf going all around the office and two heavy duty shelves in the recessed part of the office.
the wall across from the door is too weak to support much, since it&amp;rsquo;s not really drilled into anything and just hangs loose. that one might be for the candy shelf.
isaac indicated he might be able to provide a ladder. we also need to hang christmas lights.
date of the lan party
date is november 6th. we are awaiting confirmation from john kapenga.
presentation scheduled at parkview
tentative for joe&amp;rsquo;s presentation on guis. probably will be c-208.
treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report: same as last week.

notice to all: yakko will be down from 8pm to 8am. it is not our fault!
the little fridge is dead. eric proposes that it be thrown out, since it has a large colony of mold which has taken up residence in the fridge and will probably never be worthy of being used. motion carries.
the dates are being changed for the presentations. eric will present on basic unix next week. tim will follow with debugging techniques and joe will follow on linux guis. the web site has been changed to reflect the new schedule.
eric proposes to work on the office the saturday following this one.
eric and mike from ann arbor will work on adding shelving units so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit on all this stuff.
treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report
$400 in petty cash. ~$1300 in the account.
the ports have still not been vlaned.
jim cotton is apparently in china for two more weeks and no one else dares to touch the config files for fear that the world as we know it might end.
status on yakko: we are running redhat and the gentoo partitions are mounted read only. we&amp;rsquo;re currently back on the original. some archived messages were lost, but other than that, we&amp;rsquo;re ok.
the scsi controller is ok. the problem was in the reiser file system.
apparently, we had issues in compiles which caused chaos. tim proposes that no major changes be made to yakko for the duration of the semester. everyone agrees. undisclosed threat to those who break yakko. issues were discussed about minimizing downtime. tim suggested that a parallel yakko would be created if we wish to switch from redhat to gentoo so that downtime be minimized.
announcements
chris cut his hair. matt got a job.

(think webct) 10. we could also setup a news server (nntp). then we could offer newsgroup <=> mailing list interaction. we could also set up an nntp server for confer that would be university wide. we'd have to do this before vms goes down (which means confer would go down). 11. at some point we need to update our constitution about how we currently operate and how we are going to be operating in the future. many policies are in dire need of being updated. voting policies and descriminating between the various types of members are important policies which need to be amended. 12. last wednesday, officers spoke with the webgeek at widr about getting a new server for the stream. they are waiting for pricing lists from us and they are going to post all of their emails about the widr stream on the web for viji to see. 13. a lot of talk about getting speakers. 14. we will start meeting every two weeks until the fall semester begins.

2. computer club is out of a secretary, gotta find new one
3. get signature card at bank, give extra key to treasury who is yet to be found
4. wanted:
treasurer, to keep track of all money involved in computer club, will get spare key.
secretary, to write up minutes at computer club meetings. they also get a key. matt has been nominated to be secretary. neat. so was helio.
5. cd burner is working and away, saga continues...
6. wsac (wussac) - we tried scamming money from them to get widr on internet and do wireless lan
told us flat out that they can't give us money because they don't buy equipment.
7. linux install party - january 27, 2000
need room with lots of space and outlets, ask orien, try bernhard center again?
maybe in a classroom and bring tables. there'll be linux cds, pizza, other stuff...
got ideas for a place to hold it? we want 'em.
8. ed got more cds from klug, *pat pat* good job ed
9. relatively new v-prez of information technology, replaced dark, overlord one that hated us. we should try to take the new vice prez out to lunch and show that we can be kind, gentle, caring people hehe. let ozz know if you wanna go, he'll let everyone know if she bought in.
10. gamer's guild - shut servers down to conserve energy on weekends, holidays, etc. wmgg was put on yakko (but not active) to help them out. looking for other ways to help them out, like get them a domain. it's on yakko.cs.wmich.edu/wmgg right now, but once again, not active. look at pages and see if there is anything objectionable and we could possibly put them on one of the computer club's unused ips. use a secondary machine as a server. think about if we want to do it, and what happens if we do do it. do we want a lot of credit? next week.
11. constitutional law scholar at harvard, laurence lessig, suggests looking at internet for its constitutional value. biz, polisci, soc, writers, media, journalism, anyone interested in privacy, would find this speaker interesting/useful. could help get other speakers as well. funds are needed to get him here though, chris will try to find bio info about him, possibly from his secretary. split up people and send to various depts. to bum cash for this.
go here to find out more: http://ethics.harvard.edu/people/affiliates/lessig.html
12. a calendar of mammoth proportions that is erasable and has three months on it would be nice. so would a pop and candy run. (matt, wes, and ed will do that wednesday)
13. treasurers report:
2 new members, 1 renewal, sold 3 cds, cash box has $148.63, $697.10 in bank
14. anyone want a talk or to give a talk about anything?
- getting into linux
- nfs, network file system, possibly in a few weeks (middle of term), from chris
- ozz will ask kaugars about cds/rcs (keeping code in line)
- another talk on latex
15. wes got blank cds from best buy, so if anyone wants to experiment with the c-club's burner for $1 probably, let someone on c-club staff know.
people who attended this computer club meeting:
ozz, prez
matt, secretary maybe
wes, veep
jim (new member)
christopher oliver (see #11)
adam
erik (wrote this issue of the minutes)
bob (another potential member?, needs help getting linux on his packard bell)
ed, the treasurer

(bandwidth can be tuned to compensate for problems; licensing can&amp;rsquo;t be worked around.) icecast naturally &amp;ndash; opensource and runs under linux, since real&amp;rsquo;s sound quality and license structure is sooper lame. o wes is thinking of reoutfitting wakko since one hard drive is full, add a 5-6gb from ozz, take the other crap out and it&amp;rsquo;ll make a rather nice burner or streamer. ozz says decide on price and let that determine size, rather than the other way around. o remember, klug meets in 2205 dunbar every tuesday at 7pm. http://klug.armintl.com for more information. support, come out, have fun! o next semester&amp;rsquo;s computer club meetings. from going to klug meetings i have learned we need more structure. they have business first, then presentation, then talk and food. wes has come up with some presentation ideas and more are welcome (jettero has some great stuff on perl, karel can do beos, christine and ozz could do robotics&amp;hellip;) they should definitely be organized better. grabassing abounds. o the printer situation. are we gonna get a new one? all these old ones are refusing to cooperate. the parallel plug on the canon got damaged and the others are bad. net worth is still ~1500 right now, so after we do a store run and pay the phone bill we should have about a grand. the canon does work to print plain text, but nothing else; could we perhaps plug in a pcl cart and make it do postscript? ozz recommends moderate cost laser printer but says go the distance and get an expensive one; isaac suggests renting one since it won&amp;rsquo;t even be used three months out of the year, which ozz doesn&amp;rsquo;t like unless we rent it from him. but if it&amp;rsquo;s to be used by the general campus and not just casual members, we&amp;rsquo;ll need decent equipment to handle the load without breaking down. we may end up charging a nickel a page for non-members. cover page for cclub print jobs should have a cclub advertisement&amp;hellip;wes also likes having a printer, says last time we knew the print server was ready to have a printer hooked up to it. o our online membership form is kinda lame. isaac will see what he can do&amp;hellip; o bronco bash is coming. wes got the application, we will have a table as usual. how can we top the censored by wmu fiasco? maybe a booth with goggles and a sledgehammer and some old computer equipment, so people can take out their aggressions on computers in general, school, the ucc&amp;hellip;mail suggestions now! the bash is monday august 30th and starts around 3pm, so get your ideas in before then and let us know if you can help set up, work the table, etc. wes will print up more membership forms. o remember, wmu is trying to elect a new cio (computer information officer). o ozz: paul isn&amp;rsquo;t here. orien recently typed up a set of rules to abide by when using cs machines and the campus network in general, which paul tex&amp;rsquo;d to make them look nice. paul and ozz believe these should be incorporated into the membership forms as an adjunct to or replacement for the existing acceptable use policy, and will talk to orien regarding this. o richard wright has applied to be vp of information technology, which means he is one of four candidates for the position. the talks are open to faculty and staff only, apparently; we have seen no direct invitation to students. the first meeting was today at 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock; we missed it. the 2nd is monday the 21st at 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock at the fetzer lecture hall. another wednesday the 30th at 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock, also at the fetzer center, where wright will give a presentation on &amp;ldquo;supporting the research university through information technology&amp;rdquo;. tuesday july 14th at 9:15 am will be the fourth candidate. we should be there asking intelligent and insightful questions and showing a student presence. the june 30th one is two weeks away; as much as possible should be discussed and planned with trenary and kapenga. o trenary is looking for responsible cgi/perl people to do webpage jobs. mail trenary@cs.wmich.edu for details. o that&amp;rsquo;s all, there is, no more.

(burning cd&amp;rsquo;s would require a standalone machine that wasn&amp;rsquo;t running anything else, for fear of flaws in the burn process.) (ega monitors to work with lenny: two out of three are fried as far as i can tell; the third we aren&amp;rsquo;t sure about yet. d. christian will try to bring in ega cards/monitors.) [d. christian arrives. bow down!] steve: some backup definitely must be acquired. i like going with scsi, so what media shall we choose? in theory, external scsi devices could be run from hologram&amp;hellip; [full backups would take multiple cd&amp;rsquo;s but incrementals can fit on one disk, and full ones don&amp;rsquo;t need to be made that often. rewritable is standard now, packet writing is not standard yet. cd&amp;rsquo;s can be written to at least 1,000 times (according to the advertising&amp;hellip;), cost about 25 bucks each if you buy one at a time. cd&amp;rsquo;s are faster and cheaper than tapes&amp;hellip;] steve: looks like everyone likes cd&amp;rsquo;s. research on prices, compatibility, driver availability must now be done. we can also burn copies of linux distributions&amp;hellip; christian: wiley running nt would be a good bet to install the cd on &amp;ndash; more drivers available, and it&amp;rsquo;s the fastest machine we have right now. steve: scsi card prices? christian: really good ones for 300, 2940uw&amp;rsquo;s are 200-250. steve: so include a price for the card in your research. send all data to me&amp;hellip; tim: i&amp;rsquo;ll talk to ozz. steve: and asap, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss all the data we receive. the drive should be new, the card may be refurbished since there are no moving parts. dennis: we made an astounding $94 this week. account is approximately $2900. steve: still two boxes of coursepacks left, and they still haven&amp;rsquo;t had their first test yet, so we may yet still sell some. they&amp;rsquo;re in the corner by the bottle return box. elise was interested also, and pietkowski would like to do this again; i&amp;rsquo;ll speak with him about summer, but definitely fall and winter. the couch is in the office because someone came by and said we can&amp;rsquo;t have it in the hall because it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;safety hazard&amp;rsquo;. as much as it&amp;rsquo;s useful now, we&amp;rsquo;re getting rid of it by the end of the week, so say goodbye&amp;hellip; whoever takes it should wet-vacuum it to get rid of any lingering asbestos :) any further business? nay? it&amp;rsquo;s a meeting. 6:50pm.

how about nominations, but no voting &amp;rsquo;til march? darron: announce nominations and allow public comment? steve: maybe if we shut off irc until we have enough officers&amp;hellip; darron: seconded! steve: how about unofficial nominations continually? notify them of the official nominations as soon as we can legally make them under the constitution. unofficial nominations begin now, and you can nominate people who are not here. yakko backups failed again, due to&amp;hellip;causes unknown. ken thought it might have been a scripting error. home directory is only backed up through the t&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; so users t through z are still in limbo. it worked okay until it hung on the unknown; ken is still working on this. in the meantime, if you are a user whose username starts with t through z, back up your stuff if you care about it! the cs web site is now officially up and running, having replaced the old one. as always, suggestions for improvement are welcome (we know there are plenty that could be made!). as before, i would like the webteam to remain as an ongoing team, in charge of yakko pages and the cs department pages. jo wycoff is your contact person at cs. vaxstations are finally up and running. want to play? jump on one. they are not yet networked with each other or the rest of our machines. do not turn them off! if anyone is interested in working with these, any suggestions on what to do with them, etcetera&amp;hellip; come on in! at the very least, there are still people in the world hiring vms programmers&amp;hellip; darron: speaking of linux. linux for small devices&amp;hellip; very early version for the palmpilot pda. tim: linux for vax is still in beta, let&amp;rsquo;s set that up on a spare vax. steve: still have six hard drives and seven cases. we&amp;rsquo;ll be rebuilding one just to teach ourselves how; audience participation is welcome. tim: and of course, the original goal of using the vaxen as x stations is still a very desirable thing. steve: if nobody has other business, i&amp;rsquo;ll open nominations now&amp;hellip; floor is open for unofficial nominations to officer positions. wesley: i can handle responsibility, but i don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of free time. next semester i&amp;rsquo;ll have between 15 and 17 credits, so i could be vp? tim: seconded, steve: thirded steve: of course, el presidente will be the hardest to fill.. if we don&amp;rsquo;t get one, wesley will take over and share lots of tasks with the secondary vp, so you won&amp;rsquo;t be blown away. paul wants to be something&amp;hellip; tim: secretary? steve: seconded. remember, people can be nominated for more than one position; it might be nice to give them some choice in the matter&amp;hellip; what would darron like to do? can he count? darron: no. steve: treasurer! all the books are in order, the only thing you have to do is deposit money&amp;hellip; tim: or you could be vp of finance and report to the treasurer, and figure out how to make more money for the club. steve: i nominate darron for vp of operations, in charge of hardware, software, and finances&amp;hellip; and reporting to treasurer. and if we don&amp;rsquo;t get a treasurer, you end up counting money. and nominate tim for vp of finance also, just in case&amp;hellip; dennis: seconded! tim: i don&amp;rsquo;t wanna be wsa rep. you all knew that already&amp;hellip; (much discussion of the parking scam/scandal/whatnot) donald&amp;rsquo;s mom came in to pick up wakko and the monitor&amp;hellip;we need more monitors! wesley will check out the 50-buck refurbished vga&amp;rsquo;s; we have plenty of spare video adapters. will mail paul and ask him if he&amp;rsquo;s still bringing in his spare monitor/card. and see if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to use the vaxen monitors on pc&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s that, meeting over, 6:58pm. come again&amp;hellip; "><div class=card-header><time datetime=1998-02-12 class=card-date><span class=date-day>12</span>

(both on yakko.edu and yakko.com&amp;hellip;.) chicago trip is still on. spring break is feb 28-mar 8, so we&amp;rsquo;d have a full seven days. if anyone has a preference let us know soon, we need to secure a van and make other arrangements. for those interested, there are only fifty (50) more class days left, not including spring break or finals.. i know, i counted. i have senioritis. coursepacks! the sale went well, even though we have quite a few left over. another cs224 exam is coming up very soon, so we may still have another surge of customers after february 15th. again, we want to continue doing this, not just for fall and winter, but year round &amp;ndash; the students get a cheaper coursepack, and the club makes money. for spring and summer, i need once again to know who can hold office hours and sell these things, because i am leaving! without someone here, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do it, so please let us know if you can help. pookie! keys: steve, tim, dennis, paul, ian, ken, trenary&amp;hellip;sue? should be ten keys floating around. track &amp;rsquo;em down. my mass mailing asking what people want from the club: i&amp;rsquo;ve gotten about 25 responses so far. what do they use yakko for? pretty much everyone said email. what do they want the club to do? about 95% said, either the club&amp;rsquo;s already doing it, or i can&amp;rsquo;t think of anything, or i don&amp;rsquo;t know. time to use your imagination&amp;hellip;if all you want is email, why not use the vax? i would like to drop membership dues to 10.00/year starting next year. the club was started not to make money from its members because we knew members didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything. we&amp;rsquo;re doing well enough from coursepacks and such to have a good income without gouging our members, who deserve the best deal we can give them. when i joined as a sophomore, i had no idea what the club did, and that 20 bucks up front was a bit off-putting. i want something on the door that advertises our webpage ability, and a startup fee of 10 bucks will hopefully grab a lot more people. we need to heavily advertise web pages&amp;hellip;not enough people are taking advantage of it! anyway&amp;hellip;since all our members are so scattered around with when they joined, how long their membership is good for, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to be fair about when to implement the change in dues. motion by steve: that membership dues be reduced to 10.00/year. seconded by ian, dennis&amp;hellip; good with everyone here? as unanimous as it gets&amp;hellip;except for jettero, who will write the dissenting opinion tomorrow. motion passes. we now have new membership/web forms available. spread the word about our new reduced rates! did i mention the quake server is running on wiley? pop is on sale at target right now so i got ten cases. anyone going there, pick up a couple! and we still have more folks asking for gum&amp;hellip; jettero wants more equipment. steve notes we have three 486 motherboards not being used&amp;hellip;lenny is one of them. we have ram coming out of our ears. dennis notes we should do more with the equipment we have before we go buying more, to which most concur. ian proposes some sort of semi-detailed inventory be made so we know what we need to go with what we have. steve, ian and just about everyone agrees with the concept of getting lots of different hardware/software to show linux&amp;rsquo; strength as an integrated networking platform. dennis: our account balance is good enough i&amp;rsquo;d open to suggestions as to purchasing. paul ruminates on setting up a subspace server&amp;hellip; darren wants to turn wiley into an nt server. steve: i propose we set a date to do it! i said this three or four months ago&amp;hellip; get a license from ken since he&amp;rsquo;s setting up an nt network? he&amp;rsquo;s got spare licenses&amp;hellip; or i can sell my copy to darren before i leave. we are definitely short on monitors&amp;hellip; jettero: i have a spare monitor and pci diamond stealth&amp;hellip; i can bring them in. darren: how many people have nt experience? me, jettero.. i&amp;rsquo;ve been running nt server 4 for a while now. steve: nt installation party, with pizza and pop! asap. suggestions for date and time are welcomed. at your convenience&amp;hellip; dennis: treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report. last week we made 65, this week we made 82. other business? wesley: there&amp;rsquo;s a place near my home that sells used monitors for 50 bucks or so..close to auburn hills, detroit area. factory refurbished monitors are 150 or so. i go home every couple of weeks, i&amp;rsquo;ll check it out. also will email their url to people. steve: dennis, did you pay ozz for the switch? dennis: not yet; i&amp;rsquo;ll attend to that. darren: some good backup hardware&amp;hellip;if we go down, it&amp;rsquo;s oops! steve: can ken put us back in his backup list? darren: i&amp;rsquo;ll speak to him; tim probably knows more than i at this time. i think ken was timing out connecting to us via nfs. we can at least set it up for a week and have him let us know of any problems. steve: i&amp;rsquo;ve decided the tape drive is a lost cause, so suggestions on a new backup device will be welcomed. and with that, we call it, 7:13pm. that&amp;rsquo;s a meeting. thanks for sharing!

the secretary&amp;rsquo;s office in friedmann should have one. moving right along darron and tim upgraded yakko to redhat 4.2 to protect from the latest and greatest system holes. linux and windows nt are the only os&amp;rsquo;s with patches against teardrop attacks&amp;hellip; (now we can work on important things like getting the sound working again :) more volunteers are still needed for the cs webpage project! i&amp;rsquo;d like to have it as done as possible by christmas break, and most of our current volunteers are on and off&amp;hellip;non-club members are welcome. now the real fun! yesterday i had a very disruptive email from chris rand at netlink, saying that chris michaels was called to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; some links on yakko.com to stop pointing to yakko.edu. i was aware that jay&amp;rsquo;s page was the only one doing that, and let it happen because jay has a paragraph of text on yakko.edu. dr. wright or one of his underlings saw this, called nelson, nelson called trenary and trenary called netlink. so we poked around and found that wright seemed to be snooping in about every orifice on the website. he&amp;rsquo;d been everywhere, some places more than once (s*x). a few other folks in ucc were also doing this. so tim and i coded hosts.deny to refuse connections from wright&amp;rsquo;s machine, administrative machines in ucc etc., all get a &amp;ldquo;403 forbidden&amp;rdquo;. so now he has to go to some neutral terminal to see the webpage. tim: we have people (speak of the devil!) who worry that this may seem to be an escalation to make wright&amp;rsquo;s blood pressure rise, especially when things seem to be going our way&amp;hellip; steve: i mailed trenary just to let him know what was going on&amp;hellip; i said well, wright&amp;rsquo;s been hitting everything in our site and i think it&amp;rsquo;s just too much bandwidth&amp;hellip; we can&amp;rsquo;t afford to waste any university bandwidth on this sort of thing, after all. this isn&amp;rsquo;t vindictive, it&amp;rsquo;s just to let him know we know you know. if he raises a fuss we can and will undo it, but i did not appreciate the idea of our not being contacted directly. darren: tim was saying tit for tat, and i do feel this retribution streak, like it&amp;rsquo;s a game. i know if i were sitting over there and looking at the clb webpages and suddenly couldn&amp;rsquo;t, i&amp;rsquo;d know something was up. jay, tim and myself have pages up&amp;hellip; tim: i took mine down. steve: same thing with our cs project, you have to know the address because it isn&amp;rsquo;t linked from anywhere. i don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re worried about anything other than the fact that we might be hosting student pages. nothing was specifically mentioned, chris michaels removed jay&amp;rsquo;s link to yakko.edu, all other links there point to themselves at yakko.com. i see it as ucc looking so hard for something to hit us with that they could have our plug pulled on yakko, they never got in touch with myself or tim&amp;hellip; they apparently didn&amp;rsquo;t know that i am in charge of yakko.com, not chris michaels, a third party who has graciously donated equipment and time to the club and our purpose. it was only by chance that i found out about this, and they could have done anything and i would have found out after the fact. it felt like a slap in the face that they did not bring their concerns to the club first. i need to talk to don nelson and find out who brought the complaint in the first place, and we will deal with the matter appropriately. and there&amp;rsquo;s no policy that says we have to make our web page available&amp;hellip; darren: and as always, if they felt like it they could trot in here and reboot and do whatever they like. steve: paul igniacco and the office of student life have to see our page, that&amp;rsquo;s still the only &amp;ldquo;approval&amp;rdquo; we have to undergo. in any case, if i had been contacted, i would have dealt with the matter. and we shall see what response this draws, and perhaps it will give us a little insight into who is working at cross purposes with us, and what their motivation is&amp;hellip;and keep a close eye on the access logs over the next few days. quake server is still go. more as it develops. we may have to limit the number of players&amp;hellip;netlink will get theirs up within the next week. new 486, 120mb hard drive, just needs a monitor and it&amp;rsquo;s ready to go&amp;hellip; we still have two other 486 boards to test out. treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report: 68 bucks last week, 49 this week. sales going down due to lack of product, no doubt! shopping trip tomorrow. no further business, adjourned 6:50. thanks for being. no meeting next week due to thanksgiving holidays&amp;hellip; "><div class=card-header><time datetime=1997-11-20 class=card-date><span class=date-day>20</span>

(darron and dennis both have 4.2, they'll attend) i'll make a motd that says back up now! darron: a general nfs backup would also be nice, being somewhat overdue... dennis: 87 bucks this week! steve: 6:50, meeting adjourned, signed sealed and delivered. thanks for being here.

(note: we need some more staples :) steve: now the big thing! today i got a phone call from mike martin, the assistant to diether. he would like us to have a meeting w/diether, trenary, nelson, wright. myself, tim, dianne schwartz and carol someone (legal representative) will meet with them tuesday to discuss student webpages. i believe this was orchestrated by diether, why is not clear, but he appears to be interested in determining what can be done. (might this be his attempt at going out with a bang, something he can be remembered for?) therefore, tim and i need a lot of ammunition going into this meeting&amp;hellip; (tim has been instructed to leave his postal weapons at home). i still have info from when we spoke to ombudsman regarding usage statistics back when we analyzed our weblogs. i would also like a list of every university in michigan. ian: i saved that a while back, let me know if you need another copy. steve: we will not necessarily go in there &amp;ldquo;packing heat&amp;rdquo;, we want a lot of defensive information. ultimately, we have webpages right now but the student body at large does not, and i&amp;rsquo;d like that to be our goal going in. with calm, solid arguments, we can quickly defuse any arguments: bandwidth - legalities and liabilities - &amp;ldquo;fairness&amp;rdquo; (they keep saying &amp;ldquo;it isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as the cclub makes it sound&amp;rdquo;; we know it can be done on a shoestring!) all those signed petitions need to go with us. tim: i want to know what&amp;rsquo;s going on with them, they shut us down and we have no idea what their rationalizations have been other than conflicting messages every time the herald knocks on their door. steve: at the very least, i am optimistic enough to think this will lead to a resolution. i&amp;rsquo;d also like printouts of some fine examples of member pages (resume, graphics, etc). i don&amp;rsquo;t have the laser printer at home working (which is just like the one we have here)&amp;hellip; tim: meshkin says it might just be low on toner&amp;hellip; darren: might be the cable&amp;hellip; steve: in any case, i need printouts by monday to look over. i don&amp;rsquo;t want to bring the nudes&amp;hellip; tim: darn! (awwwwww all around) steve: if diether asks, we can give him the address and we can show him, but if the topic is not brought up there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for us to shove them in their face. any other topics that would be good to approach? tim: they have said there&amp;rsquo;s no legal issue, but he&amp;rsquo;s bringing a lawyer&amp;hellip;? i don&amp;rsquo;t believe they&amp;rsquo;re unconcerned anymore with this aspect. we should be on our guard. prior restraint will be a very bad thing. steve: that may come up in the meeting, some form of administration, red tape and hoops students have to jump through before their pages are public. tim: cs department will want control&amp;hellip; steve: so will organizational pages also need to be controlled? where is the line drawn? where will student pages ultimately be hosted &amp;ndash; do they want one centralized source (to make it easier to control)? (discussion of issues of &amp;ldquo;web review board&amp;rdquo;; you know &amp;rsquo;em, you love &amp;rsquo;em; we all know it&amp;rsquo;s impractical, and we should not accept it because wmu would be much more liable and this is not a good issue to bend on. -tim) steve: i will not underestimate wright. we&amp;rsquo;ve got precedents, i don&amp;rsquo;t know how much this lawyer knows about internet law in general or our specific case; if she&amp;rsquo;s the one wright&amp;rsquo;s been dealing with, we need to educate her. tim: shari steele at eff can set her straight if necessary. steve: we need to know exactly what their arguments against will be, and the only way we can find out is jump into the meeting. tim: the large number of people attending makes me think this will be another stonewall, but i&amp;rsquo;m willing to eat crow&amp;hellip; i&amp;rsquo;ve spoken w/trenary about potential problems from ucc who do not seem very happy about webpages and have been whispering in wright&amp;rsquo;s ear. steve: this meeting will be our last chance at really resolving this before 1998. diether&amp;rsquo;s replacement may be much harder to deal with, we have a meeting, so strike while the iron is hot. again, any bit of information that may be helpful to us, mail it to both tmiley and steve. that&amp;rsquo;s the agenda, what else? dennis, treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report: balance still around 2k, only did ~40 bucks this week. for 500 bucks we could have a very nice 486 with a tape drive, found on one of the misc.forsale groups. currently being used as an nt box, we could use it for nt or 95&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;d need a monitor to go with it, keyboard/mouse also, but the monitor is the big issue. (much discussion ensues) tim will mail the guy and ask some more questions. we&amp;rsquo;ll also check ebay.com (auction site) for any new or used equipment at bargain basement prices. no other business, meeting adjourned, 7:14pm. hot-cha!

[and hey, we can always use an excuse for a hardware upgrade&amp;hellip;] all the files are ready to go, space is reserved on wiley&amp;rsquo;s hard drive&amp;hellip;which brings us to&amp;hellip; are we going to move the pentium motherboard to yakko? steve: i believe wiley as a game server would be preferable to having it host the &amp;ldquo;os of the week&amp;rdquo;, but of course if we get another pc up that would still be worth pursuing. darren: qoholeth didn&amp;rsquo;t renew his account, his chess server software is still sitting around so i&amp;rsquo;ll copy it and get it running again. did we want the talker (minimoo) up? steve: sure, put it on wiley. [discussion of partition/space issues] that&amp;rsquo;s the agenda! other issues? tim: wsa report! still sucks. but! budget proposal as mentioned in herald gives some hope for the future. they want to spend two thousand bucks of wsa&amp;rsquo;s money to get some touchy-feely motivational speaker to come motivate everybody to stop infighting&amp;hellip; the other thing, actually useful, they are making some progress with the bus proposal, promotions so people will actually know about it and hopefully use it. i will draft a wsa proposal with cory watt to restore wmu student homepages. as usual i would love any assistance on flyer/pamphlets/petitionss. everybody grab one when you leave and stick &amp;rsquo;em places! treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report: 85 bucks grossed on sales this week, balance hovering right around 2,000. i&amp;rsquo;ll prepare a report on our cash outlay on food and pop versus gross so we can see if this is really worthwhile&amp;hellip; steve: nobody else? meeting adjourned, 6:45. see ya later! 2,000.

(two actual members showed up over the course of the meeting :) meeting declared 6:12. what is tim doing right now? buggering the password file! tim&amp;rsquo;s trying his hand at a c program to make it easier to expire accounts that have to go bye bye. steve: everyone who mailed or called me has paid. we still have some expired folks who haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten in touch with us, so those folks will have accounts suspended until they contact us. so far, approximately half of those folks expired have renewed their membership. tim: i&amp;rsquo;ll also write an unexpire. steve: we need another table to put in front of the other window to put vaxstations on and store pop under. the vaxes are up and running and are networked to each other! tim: we ought to talk to wmu&amp;rsquo;s vax people to make sure all the current hardware won&amp;rsquo;t have a problem talking to these things. steve: as soon as we can get them in here, i&amp;rsquo;d like to try hooking them up to wiley, then for the future, possibly assigning ip addresses. wayne has named them already, i told him to use tiny toons(tm) characters again. each machine has an external port to add another scsi hard drive, so even though each one only has the ~100mb&amp;hellip; web pages at netlink. steve: we&amp;rsquo;ve finished the acceptable use policy people need to read and sign. the 5mb quota holds, with a 7mb limit. i&amp;rsquo;ll make copies of the policy to keep here in the office. folks come in who want webpages should fill out: name username signature and date officer signature optional comments they should pick a password at that time which is different from their yakko account, and not write it on the sheet, but instead mail it to steve or frogfarm so we can establish their account. the signing officer should put the form in the drawer with membership forms for the database&amp;hellip;darren? darren: i got it running, now it&amp;rsquo;s up to the implementors. steve: i wanted something that can be accessible via any terminal, no graphics required. back to the webpages&amp;hellip; steve: we need a new &amp;ldquo;members list&amp;rdquo;. i&amp;rsquo;d rather start over and dynamically add to it as people add webpages. darron: for those members with webpages, list them, for those that don&amp;rsquo;t just have an email link. steve: agreed. members.html should be redirected over to yakko.com and edited appropriately. steve: i have flyers tim made up, which are pretty slick. need help on distributing them. i think between this, the herald article yesterday, and the new banner over our door courtesy of dennis (everyone cheers), we should start getting a bit more recognition. i&amp;rsquo;ll leave flyers in the office, they&amp;rsquo;re already approved, so we can use every hand in getting them at approved posting places, or even off-campus. steve: last issue, the web development team. i met with wycoff again, she is very interested still in the club designing the computer science dept website. i told her also we were interested, and if we can do this, it could become an ongoing annual project, which would be very appropriate for us as an organization. right now they have a lot of information but it&amp;rsquo;s very bland&amp;hellip; darren: also they use .shtml&amp;hellip;blecch! steve: so we can totally revamp it if we like. she gave me a list of things she would like to see. we&amp;rsquo;ll need to have separate meetings for the web design. i got lots of responses from the mass email from people who can&amp;rsquo;t make it to our regular meetings but could attend at other times. perhaps this could turn into a way to get cs student pages up like there were before, i brought that possibility up and she had no problem with that. once again, all interested parties should mail me to coordinate times for a meeting. i&amp;rsquo;d like to have the first meeting sometime next week, so get the word out. steve: i still want to do the project with wiley. i want to get the pentium into yakko! (much discussion of swapping muds around, the issue of performance and the perceived need for better performance, etc) darren: this motherboard is better than the old one, so we hopefully won&amp;rsquo;t face the same problems we did last time we tried to upgrade yakko. steve: i vote strongly for swapping. tim: how about at the same time we upgrade redhat? steve: how much parts do we have in here to make another system? would it be in our best interest to try to piece together another? tim: we have a small hard drive, but it would basically have to leech off yakko. i believe we have a 100mb sitting around right now. steve: i&amp;rsquo;d like all these motherboards in the file cabinet tested for starters, eventually going through all the other equipment. any volunteers, anyone who has extra equipment they want to donate? tim: wsa report! they sucked, but their meeting was mercifully short. i spoke with a chris bakotic, who suggested we put the petitions in the labs and residence halls, try to get everyone into a meeting with dr. wright, get norm grant and nancy kroes, etc., involved. the assumption is that he wants to resolve the issue. i put our budget request in for the internet 2001 lectures &amp;ndash; i confirmed the microsoft dweeb, probly from a local regional office; also declan mccullagh (yeah!). darron: i know someone at a travel agency&amp;hellip; tim: also put in request for a video, 65 bucks for a year 2000 video, use the video as an opener for a discussion point. if we pull this off it will make a difference in the future for getting more budget grants. i don&amp;rsquo;t know how anal they&amp;rsquo;ll be about documentation; statistically, we can&amp;rsquo;t count on it, but we asked for very little, and this is the first year they have a $9,000 ceiling. i have an appointment next saturday, october 25th, to go beg for money for chicago field trip/lecture speakers/etc. tim: once again, if anyone wants to be on the student budget allocation committee&amp;hellip; treasurer&amp;rsquo;s report! dennis: made about 80 bucks this week. diet pop is needed. steve: meeting closed due to degradation into alcohol jokes. thankfully no spam yet&amp;hellip; tim: we need a computer named spam! spam.cs.wmich.edu&amp;hellip; steve: and if someone puts together another one we can name it treet! meeting adjourned more or less unanimously, 7:00pm. oh, the pain of it all.

(darren has one running&amp;hellip;) tim: the bbs died a quick death. darren: nuts is pretty much maintenance free for a talker&amp;hellip; steve: whatever this is, we have to have it running on the vax (ugh!) because that&amp;rsquo;s where most people hang out [because they don&amp;rsquo;t know any better!]. xtank (for those with x terminals) tournaments? ian: games are time sinks&amp;hellip; steve: true, but the club was originally founded out of games. when we had monster running things were rather busy. tim: just for giggles i could try to compile conquer on the vax&amp;hellip; steve: i don&amp;rsquo;t know what the vax people do these days other than email. if anyone comes up with ideas on how to increase club involvement, put it forth. at the very least we need all our officers consistently attending. tim: we need increased attendance by grunt members! we have lots of people graduating this year or already graduated, and if we get complacent, by this time next year this room could be turned into some boring old grad student kaffeclatch thing, and the computer club&amp;rsquo;s twenty-year history could just vanish. wsa stuff tim: if anyone around here had any sense they&amp;rsquo;d be up in arms over the 10% tuition increase. sure, the parking problems are bad, but there are more important things to worry about&amp;hellip; darren&amp;rsquo;s wsa report: i made a foil swan out of a gum wrapper. tim: after the meeting i met with corey watt, and he seems to think that i&amp;rsquo;m his right hand man. we brainstormed on trying to get wsa to do something useful. i&amp;rsquo;m trying to help &amp;ldquo;channel his energy&amp;rdquo; while keeping my focus on the computer club and presenting our issues to wsa. advertising stuff! tim still needs to get ahold of michelle wall. an idea has been proffered. text has been written, a photograph has been conceptualized, all that remains is to set up and snap the photo. we&amp;rsquo;ll try to have it done before next meeting. meeting with light no word yet&amp;hellip;why are we not surprised? wait until the webpage news starts to get out. trenary will have to address the issue somehow, lest he again be accused of stonewalling. let&amp;rsquo;s motivate him to admit it&amp;rsquo;s not his issue, say who has the real problem with webpages and climb the ladder from there. doc light has more pull than doc wright (we&amp;rsquo;re living in a doc seuss book!) tim: i got mail from phil zimmermann, he&amp;rsquo;s too busy to come talk. declan is still okay but i have to get off my butt and finish the student budget allocation request. all my requests so far have been with john vanderpool [sp?] as chairman, and they were all denied. treasury report: still getting membership money. our freidmann mailbox had seven renewals the other day, and two more today. we made about 95 bucks on pop and food this week. current balance is over 1600. members have even been slipping money under the door&amp;hellip; :) meeting doa, 7:05. gleep!

or are they all mudding? who can we nominate? not much on the agenda&amp;hellip; -- the other day we got a call from jim ridge, in charge of the soapbox derby. he'd heard through the grapevine that we used to run the soapbox derby times, and he says that now they're going to start doing it again and it needs some timers. if we are available to do the timing and it's something we'd like to do, he'd appreciate it. - does anyone still know how to use this equipment? darron: we ended up using stopwatches on our watch last time because somebody tried to hook it up to a car battery. then i thought we pawned off what was left to engineering. darren: some thrown away, some gone to ozz, now we have one box that says &#34;timer&#34; on it. darron: the engineering club has done it the last couple of times. steve: this does seem more of an engineering than computer thing, it just happened that we had the equipment at the time and we volunteered. i'll call and refer him to the eng folks. next: ton of suns issue - another dept within whirlpool decided &#34;well, don't get rid of it after all, we can use it.&#34; steve: i got a call from bryan and bryan's boss, who was apologetic for leading us on this way. so still possibly at some point in the future if they have stuff, we'll be considered again. tim: ken said he might have had room for them... consensus: oh well, lessons learned, better luck next time. steve: vaxstations. tomorrow i have a meeting with wayne, who will take the ones currently underneath yakko's desk and consolidate them, put the hobbyist licensed os on them, install xwindows and tcp/ip, and tinker with all of them, including possibly putting up a proxy server so we don't need to request more ip addresses from wmu. tim: we still have reserved pinky, brain, lenny, coredump, sagfault [sp]. we could probably change those last three to skippy, slappy and mindy or something like that. if i recall the vax's don't need more than 6 characters per name. steve: so soon we will have five to eight fully loaded systems ready to hook up. then we face the problem of space. perhaps since nobody's using the workbench except to store crap on, we could put two there, maybe one on the desk by the window, and then move the pop out and put in another table maybe two. x windows all the way around the room...so start thinking about where to get table, what to put where. deadline for membership dues are tomorrow! for the time of tomorrow until the time somebody feels angered or willing to disable accounts, the script has been written.... tim snickers i know this is tim's favorite part, but a lot of folks have frantically contacted me and said the check's in the mail, so one week grace period for those who have contacted the club by the deadline. if we don't get mail or a phone call, account will be disabled. after two weeks if no contact, the account is deleted. tim: i want to back up just the ones that we disable, that won't take much space. steve: last item. yakko.cs.wmich.com is up! you can ping it, ian and i can log in because we have shell accounts. they're still messing with some sort of adduser script to make it easier on us to establish accounts, directory structure, etc. tim: advertisement! i found that 1/8th of page is 125 bucks for a student organization. according to wsa pres, best day to advertise is thursday. strategies for placement, orientation and content. next to a showgirls! ad? advantages and disadvantages. tim: shelly {sp} wall may be writing a herald story. if she calls we should make sure we tell her about the return of our webpages. i would rather have someone write an opinion column than an article. but ideally, all three should be done: opinion, article and advertisement! we need to have folks write up a bunch of sample opinions, since opinion will likely be the one we need to work hardest on getting. steve: also, replies to opinions, or editorials. the exposure is the relevant thing, to generate visibility for us, as well as some sort of response. tim: should we vote on this? probably should. 125 bucks on thursday is my suggestion. steve: how soon can we whip up a bunch of things before we decide if it's worth it? i'd like to get a design and see it before we vote, since we all seem to agree that the cost/benefit could swing either way. is there cost difference for color/black&amp;white? tim: article will probably come out next week, and i'd really like to have the ad the same week as the article...can we have an emergency resolution? steve: if we come up with something we'll put it here in the office and invite folks for public comment. this is club money, should be spent with member's interests. tim: i'll mail and see about having art whipped up. steve: how about the old guy from the metallica video trapped in the room, gangly and old and sick looking...get him in a nightcap and a wmu hat (no shirt so you can see how dead he looked). something like that is what i want to shoot for. consensus: caption is the most important part. big text up top to grab eye, slightly smaller below picture which is more in depth but still short and sweet, which conveys the central issue: we have webpages [back]. any other issues? tim: wsa meeting was stupid, i hated it, someone please take responsibility off my hands. if you actually read the article they had another article. all the talk about compensation will now wait a few weeks. other junk. i talked to cory watt and he's very gung ho, student affairs wants to deal with this, so i think he's the guy willing to work with us. we're talking about how to fix wsa, and i hope to have a more positive report next time. treasurer's report: we have ~1500 bucks in the club account. we didn't make as much on sales as last time. tim: i'm taking over since steve is on the phone. any more business? no? we're adjourned! another triumph for democracy.

(blush) need to grab net-link&amp;rsquo;s logo and put a link there with the mirror url. tim will update the refresh script to point to net-link and tell declan we don&amp;rsquo;t need the mit mirror. we should find out if we even need &amp;ldquo;approval&amp;rdquo; for the page before we go asking for it&amp;hellip; status on ftp site: being worked on still. steve says real soon now, after some messing about with tests, barring extenuating circumstances it looks on track. vaxstations: steve talked with his contact he lent the machine to. he has a hobbyists license on the machine, the os is running fine, but he thinks the keyboard or the keyboard port is dead. he had it up in a week and a half, so it looks good to get the rest up and running as needed or wanted. two tons of suns! and that&amp;rsquo;s the truth,&amp;hellip;two machines 5 foot high, 4 foot wide, 3 foot deep. donated to us by whirlpool thanks to bryan newcastle. they are ours to take next friday. problem: they weigh about a ton apiece and that&amp;rsquo;s not exaggerating&amp;hellip;bring one good truck or two lesser ones and lots of people, and maybe rent some equipment&amp;hellip;we don&amp;rsquo;t have a truck, we don&amp;rsquo;t have any place to put them, but we want &amp;rsquo;em! question: russell asks: are they useful? steve: depends on what you want to use &amp;rsquo;em for! they have a lot of memory and disk space it seems&amp;hellip;tim sez 64 gb ram?!?! we don&amp;rsquo;t even have a 220v outlet for em!! isaac: get a bigger office on the ground floor? steve: ken doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about this yet&amp;hellip;.maybe we could put a bow on it and present it to him? tim: ozz offered to store them, altho&amp;rsquo; he&amp;rsquo;s moving this week so this isnt exactly a good time. i recommend that if we take these machines we strip them down for parts. isaac: can we examine them onsite? tearing them apart there would be nice. tim: we need logistics. we&amp;rsquo;ll also have to provide a paper for their records (tax exemption for them :). longterm: let&amp;rsquo;s look at the webpage thing&amp;hellip;okay, so the administration still has their asses in the 19th century and don&amp;rsquo;t want student pages on their account. however, they&amp;rsquo;re willing to branch us off their network. if the herald libels bill gates and he wants to sue wmu&amp;hellip; steve: we still need to find someplace to put &amp;rsquo;em that has 220, most likely offcampus. the pinky and the brain incident was not productive and more of a waste of time and energy than anything else. let&amp;rsquo;s not repeat that mistake! steve says nay&amp;hellip;size, manpower, for what results? granted it would be cool, but we won&amp;rsquo;t know what use they are until we sit down and tinker. i&amp;rsquo;ll talk to bryan and ask questions, what do they have problems with, what have they used them for in the past, how do they cool them, and get back. right now i don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but i might be persuaded. new officers! we&amp;rsquo;ve had some graduates and movings away, leaving spaces in exec board. right now office manager, secretary and vp of finance are vacant. office manager is appointed position, other two are elected. we&amp;rsquo;ll elect those two asap. office hours need to be adhered to! keep that office open as much as possible, sell that stuff, answer questions, promote visibility! anyone able and willing to fill more hours, check the existing schedule to see what&amp;rsquo;s vacant. steve: email from kapenga and nelson said project&amp;rsquo;s already over with. tim: announcement for software engineering students who want jobs. those looking to graduate in april 98 or so, positions available. email tmiley for all the gory details (lots of realtime development). (karel donated a blank cd for the display case) wed oc 22nd 6-8 pm bernhardt center room 211, will be a meeting for lots of more info on the above jobs. url to sign up/register: http://jobs.dosa.wmich.edu/ steve: oct 2nd, job crew fair in bernhardt center, altho&amp;rsquo; i could be wrong. just go, don&amp;rsquo;t look for a job&amp;hellip; :) spam on root: something on aspiring careers keeps getting thrown at root. if anyone&amp;rsquo;s interested in jobs in malaysia and southeast asia, let tim know, otherwise he will toss it out. darren s ain&amp;rsquo;t here so we can&amp;rsquo;t ask him about jo wycoff, but tim had a meeting with her. she&amp;rsquo;s webmaster for cs dept and they want a massive new webpage redesign. volunteers welcome for a nice spiffy cleanup job, mail bkelvis or tmiley. wsa sucks! tim: lots of blah blah, same thing the last two or three wsa presidents have said, but nonetheless i have made some progress, i actually voted someone down :). what i really want to know is&amp;hellip;someone actually did a constitutional amendment that says no more compensation for wsa officers! some years ago the big compensation stink was raised, this attempted to reverse it. if the judicial council determines that it&amp;rsquo;s valid to vote an amendment in the senate then they&amp;rsquo;ll bring it to a vote whether they want to add this amendment. i can see where the president and other folks are coming from given the amount of time, foregoing of work, etc., that wsa officers do. on the other hand, it might make wsa a little more legit as a student body. i&amp;rsquo;m undecided at the moment. anyone have any input? kelly: my opinion is that wsa doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent anybody. if they were actually representing someone and doing some work, which we don&amp;rsquo;t see, it might be worth some compensation. tim: tuition reimbursement or waiver might be better? i tend to agree that they don&amp;rsquo;t set a good example. they had a booksale on the vax which didn&amp;rsquo;t last long&amp;hellip; can&amp;rsquo;t think of much else. in the meantime, any volunteers to replace tim in hell as our wsa representative is welcome to take over for him! the main reason we&amp;rsquo;re doing this is i&amp;rsquo;m trying to get webpages back&amp;hellip;i&amp;rsquo;m having a meeting w/ damien flores, we&amp;rsquo;re the entire computer programming and utilization committee between the two of us. imagine the power! he&amp;rsquo;s in charge of the wsa webpage, their forum on confer (which purged recently after i made a lot of anti-wsa postings&amp;hellip;i&amp;rsquo;m sure i had nothing to do with this). last item on agenda, cs projects! (kim and chris arrive with lots o&amp;rsquo; food) steve: ken and i were talking this summer about projects he has he would just love volunteers on. i&amp;rsquo;ll mass email all club members on these from now on with all relevant details. the club started out doing these things, that&amp;rsquo;s how we got a lot of our equipment, we need to regain our focus on all the little things we do for this school. recabling the suns, a little reprogramming, restructuring of odin&amp;hellip;all good learning projects which may well develop into other things. club members gain experience and profs get stuff done for cheap, everyone benefits. i&amp;rsquo;d like either tim or myself to be contacts with ken, so email steve or tmiley with questions or offers. tim: gotta recompile packages on odin. who wants to meet with ken? he&amp;rsquo;ll create a directory for you, you&amp;rsquo;ll compile a package, make sure it works on the suns&amp;hellip;this is a very good starting point for lots of folks getting their feet wet. if any of you work on the cs machines you know how messy they are! report from treasurer: we made 86 bucks on food and pop this week! steve: new memberships, remember to put the money in the separate envelope in the cashbox. if they&amp;rsquo;re an old member renewing, make &amp;rsquo;em fill out one of the new forms, because all of these are going into the database! top drawer of the file cabinet is for the filled out forms. mail dennis to let him know of all transactions in this area. it&amp;rsquo;s very important to get the dates right so accounts don&amp;rsquo;t expire prematurely. no other business? adjourned, 7:09. thanks for showing up, all! we&amp;rsquo;re gonna use this room from now on.

(technical stuff on mirroring of passwords, etc). administration &amp;ndash; when we add member accounts to yakko, administrative account at netlink (see above) needs to create their ftp/web account. members will be unable to change their own passwords on netlink, and if they change their yakko password, netlink&amp;rsquo;s won&amp;rsquo;t change! signup sheet &amp;ndash; sign an additional &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;ve read what&amp;rsquo;s acceptable, this is how i change my password, etc&amp;rdquo;. each ftp account will have 10mb &amp;ndash; woo woo! stats page, list bunch o&amp;rsquo; stuff like hits per whatever, where folks came from, for those who care. there will be some cgi made available, they&amp;rsquo;ll install ones you write as long as they can inspect source. server will remain apache. someone should write a script to semi-automate the process&amp;hellip; in a manner more friendly than we used w/mit with those farglin&amp;rsquo; numbers. volunteers will be headhunted. motd &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;wanna have your webpage again? come see us for a signup sheet that explains it all!&amp;rdquo; that will be made available tuesday after steve meets w/ed on monday. then we won&amp;rsquo;t have to write a script and we&amp;rsquo;ll just get the folks who are interested in doing so, and they&amp;rsquo;ll have to read the acceptable use policy first. (dental cast? blood type? urine sample, stool if you&amp;rsquo;ve got the time&amp;hellip; bend over here for the plunger, sir) yakko account needs to be made for jay pike, who will be spearheading the netlink project for us &amp;ndash; steve will do that tonight. tim: advertising! spoke w/trenary, we went round and round about how asinine this whole thing is. trenary managed to successfully piss off dr. wright and vice versa, so they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to have a meeting, which hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. talked w/reporter at the herald today, should be a story soon. since we&amp;rsquo;ve been stonewalled so far, the longer we wait, the worse they look. trenary says, keep pushing! we hope to get the article out and the webpages back up more or less at the same time &amp;ndash; so we should also run an ad in the herald for the pages! how much? dennis says treasury just over a thousand, but advertising rates in herald are reportedly outrageous. membership fees should be coming in soon to stabilize our funds. need to talk to someone about doing artwork for the ad &amp;ndash; we need it to look good and we need it fast (next week). need a cool slogan, also. web-only accounts discussed again, but consensus seems not much point. focus on 20 bucks a year for full membership+yakko account+discount on pop and snacks :) +voting privileges&amp;hellip;(hey, you! participate!) if this whole &amp;ldquo;situation&amp;rdquo; drags on we&amp;rsquo;ll refocus. memberships are due soon! september 1st and december 1st are expiration dates for most accounts. mass e-mail and remind folks to cough up. thirty days&amp;rsquo; grace period. put the fear of the bofh into users! officers: constitution says to be a member you gotta pay membership dues. for officers i would like to say free membership or compensation, but there&amp;rsquo;s no clause for that. there is a clause for a five dollar membership, like when i joined, 5 for account, 15 for shell account. so officers could get reduced rate. (john forcade and john weber introduced this idea&amp;hellip;) five dollars? any objections? passes. steve found a mini-sql, we need a bloody database for members, enough of this slapdash junk. all new members/renewals etc go to dennis for verification of payment, etc. forms will go into a folder until someone gets off their duff and starts using the database. spreadsheet needs to get working also. long-term project, but short-term solution still needed&amp;hellip; steve and dennis will work together on this one. good job for secretary&amp;hellip; petitions from bronco bash &amp;ndash; steve says, 90 signatures. we&amp;rsquo;re working on more. petitions go eeeeeeeverywhere. scheduling of bernhardt center setup wed 17 thu 18, 10-2:30. talk to sue green to get a key. setup similar to bronco bash, with lots of petitions, posterboard w/list of other universities vs. wmu, etc. steven can fill for an hour between classes&amp;hellip;any other volunteers? tim&amp;rsquo;s on wed 12-2:30, we need 10-12 covered&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;and then we get to do this next week, too!&amp;rdquo; this also needs to be advertised; we still have tons of censored flyers; the original setup could be easily made more attractive with minimal effort, so if anyone feels creative, feel free! display case! here&amp;rsquo;s where we get to be real creative (no obscenity, shucks :). #17, either right outside or right across from computer room. we&amp;rsquo;ll have this from the 29th through the 6th&amp;hellip;let&amp;rsquo;s make it eye catching! info on how to find the petition, etc. 24th and 25th in dunbar hall, we need to bring our own table that time, 10-2:30 again. outdoor next to the sundial and the sleazy credit card people on the 1st and 2nd of october, 10-2:30 again. lot of outside exposure &amp;ndash; let&amp;rsquo;s take advantage of it, then move to other strategies to fill up petitions. go to sympathetic professors? let&amp;rsquo;s make some effort to check for duplicate signatures&amp;hellip; any other ideas on getting petitions into peoples&amp;rsquo; hands, talk to tim or other officers! wmu has 3,000 people, after all&amp;hellip; big sign, &amp;ldquo;want web pages? come sign petition, , , .&amp;rdquo; put it outside the office. steve: office hours need to be filled by friday or hand over your key! three hours ain&amp;rsquo;t that much&amp;hellip; we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have overlap, but if that&amp;rsquo;s what it takes, so be it. we need warm bodies here to sell snacks, get signatures, answer questions, be friendly! need to run off another copy of the food database w/updated prices. carry blank petition around with you to foist upon unsuspecting bystanders. put petition on door of office&amp;hellip; tim: vaxen! we need to do a transfer on the licenses for the software, get it in cclub&amp;rsquo;s name before we can install dec software on these machines. once that happens, ucs will help us. can we get a hobbyist&amp;rsquo;s license or have fee waived as non-profit org? at least send us t-shirts&amp;hellip; much general nattering of hard drives and such. and if things have degenerated this far&amp;hellip;going, going, gone! meeting adjourned, 7:15pm.

a third herald article! makes us look clever, makes wmu look like the clowns they are.
we are still missing one officer, fail to the lack of quorum.
dennis huppertz, prospective member, asked to serve as treasurer
&amp;ldquo;point of order&amp;rdquo; by tim: how can we elect dennis constitutionally?
&amp;ldquo;point of information&amp;rdquo; by jay: a second meeting can be issued after the first! dennis is nominated for treasurer by steve, seconded unanimously
also take into account newly nominated officials for 1997 offices
the old business account (old kent) has to be emptied out and terminated. an account already exists at first community credit union. we need to take jay&amp;rsquo;s name off the account, contact bryan newcastle regarding the old kent account. whose name should we have on the new account? president, vp, or treasurer?
dr. trenary needs a case and working power supply. if anyone has any equipment or information please extend dr. trenary every courtesy, because he&amp;rsquo;s the one who donated coredump/wiley to us.
james newscastle has a bunch of vaxstation 3100&amp;rsquo;s for the club&amp;rsquo;s disposal (13 of them). jay votes to sell them to ucc (anything to turn a profit).
darron is still working on the letter to dr. light, head of provost.
there will be no meeting till next fall semseter. the issue of the public key being missing is still a sore point and not resolved. we may have to replace the core &amp;ndash; $75.00 to replace core and $25.00 for five keys&amp;hellip;
a suggestion was made that the cclub phone directory and office number be in the wmu directory.
bronco bash coming up!!! do we want to sell stuff, demonstrate, or both? we&amp;rsquo;ll need new membership forms printed up, perhaps with a capsulized summary of our webpage woes. should have a current list of everything we offer members &amp;ndash; jay says we need new motherboard (p166?) for yakko &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;re hitting processor loads. still have gobs of diskspace and ram. webmaster should make a web-based form for folks to fill out and e-mail, print, whatever.
resolution by tim: reconcile with wsa and have fair election process&amp;hellip;
jay is selling his sgi indigo! going for $1800.00.
meeting started 6:07, ended 6:34. pasta la hasta, baby.
members present: jay, darren, darron, ian, tim, steve, craig, dennis (charles from the herald again present)
candidates for treasurer, meeting to be voted on.
d. slocum, t. miley, dominic, dennis huppertz
much hilarity and dragging up of dirty laundry. allegations of lack of drug use on the part of mr. slocum. momentary aside when mr. slocum distracted attention by asking what happened to the missing ceiling tile.
jay moves to close discussion on nominees, seconded by steve. call for election of treasurer:
d. huppertz &amp;ndash; all ayes, jay abstains
steve concurs, dennis is now treasurer
now we have a full executive board present, and we can have an&amp;hellip; executive board meeting! (if we wanted to)
meeting began 6:35, ended 6:44. let&amp;rsquo;s hear it for efficiency
