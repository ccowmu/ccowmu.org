        <h1>Chat</h1>
    </br>
        <p>
            Computer Club self-hosts a chat service using the <a href="https://matrix.org">matrix</a> protocol. Our chat is hosted on a server that is held in Floyd Hall, WMU's engineering building on the Parkview campus.

            The the open source client we use is called <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> but you may some times hear it called by previous names like Riot or Vector.
        </p>

        <h2>Logging In</h2>

        <p>
            There are multiple methods for logging into our chat: our website, the Element desktop app, and the Element mobile app.
        </p>

        <h2>Via Our Website</h2>

        <p>
            To log into chat from our website start by clicking the "Chat" tab on the homepage or by visiting cclub.cs.wmich.edu/chat 
        </p>

        <img src="/guide/example-pictures/guide 1.png" alt="Chat login landing page">

        <p>
            From here you can log in with your credentials
        </p>

        <h2>Element Desktop App</h2>

        <p>
            You can also download a standalone desktop app to access chat. Find the instructions to install on Windows, MacOS, and Linux <a href="https://element.io/get-started">here</a>.

            Since the matrix protocol is <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-01-DWeb-1.pdf">decentralized</a>, you have to tell the desktop app where our chat server lives to find us.

            Before entering your credentials, click "change"
        </p>

        <img src="/guide/example-pictures/guide 2.png" alt="Highlighted change button on login landing page">

        <p>
            Enter https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu as the homeserver URL
        </p>

        <img src="/guide/example-pictures/guide 3.png" alt="Other servers option from the sigh up page with the correct URL in for the homeserver">

        <p>
            Now you can proceed to login like you would on our website.
        </p>

        <img src="/guide/example-pictures/guide 4.png" alt="Sign in page with example credentials">

        <h2>The Element App for Andriod and IOS</h2>

        <p>
            You can download the element app on your phone and log in from there.

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app&hl=en_US">Google Play</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/element-previously-riot-im/id1083446067">App Store</a></li>
            </ul>

            The setup is similar to the desktop app, you'll have to enter our homeserver URL.

            When asked to select a server choose "Other", then enter https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu
        </p>

        <img src="/guide/example-pictures/guide 5.png" alt="mobile options selected">

        <p>
            Select "Sign In" and provide your credentials.
        </p>
