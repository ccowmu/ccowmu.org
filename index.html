        <h1>Let us introduce ourselves</h1>

        <p>We are an organic, laid back learning environment, and WMU's resident
            hackerspace. We value curiosity as much as we do knowledge, and time has
            shown that everyone has something to offer.</p>

        <p>With our own office and the resources in it, our greatest
            resource remains our people, and after almost 40 years at WMU, we've
            gained hundreds of great members doing remarkable things at companies
            like Google, Apple, LinkedIn, and RDIO.</p>

        <p>Regardless of what we know or who we are before
            joining, we grow and learn a tremendous amount from each other.
        </p>

        <p>We hope you'll come by for one of our weekly meetings on
            <strong class="big">6pm on Thursdays at 2225 Kohrman Hall.</a> </strong>
            If you can't make it in person, check out our linktree below for a link to our twitch account where we will be streaming the meeting weekly!
        </p>

        <p>If you're even a little interested in security, programming,
            hardware, electronics or have an idea for your own project then chances
            are you'll find a friend in us. See what a meeting might entail by checking
