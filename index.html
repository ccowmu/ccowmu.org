        <h1>Let us introduce ourselves</h1>
        <p>We are an organic, laid back learning environment, and WMU's
        resident hackerspace.</p>
        <p>We value curiosity as much as we do knowledge and time has
        shown that everyone has something to offer.</p> 
        <p>Even with our own office and the resources in it, our
        greatest resource remains our people, and after almost 40 years
        at WMU we've gained hundreds of great members doing remarkable
        things at companies like Apple, Linkedin, and RDIO.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what we knew, and who we were before we
        joined, we have grown and learned a tremendous amount from one
        another.</p>
        <p>We hope you'll come by for one of our weekly meetings on
        <strong class="big">Thursdays at 6PM, 2225 Kohrman Hall</strong> or drop by during
        our <a href="{{ "/wiki/Office_Hours" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">office hours</a>.</p>

        <h2>Want to learn more?</h2>
        <p>The best way to see if we're the right fit is by coming by
        the space and seeing for yourself.</p>
        <p>If you're even a little interested in security, programming,
        hardware, electronics or have an idea for your own
        <a href="{{ "/projects/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">project</a>
        then chances are you'll find a friend in us.</p>
        <p>Our members give presentations and do write-ups about interesting
        work they do; you can read about it on our blog aggregator
        <a href="{{ "/planet/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Planet CCoWMU</a>
