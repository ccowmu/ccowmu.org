What?</p><p></li><li>Matt will be giving a Debugging Strategies Presentation on March 15, 7pm.</p><p></li><li>Ed has filled out another SS4 to see if the club can&rsquo;t get our own bank account.

They fill out a form and they get a membership after they pay.</p><p></li><li>With regards to the mailing lists, have a web-based interface to them. We could host a public mailing list that people could sign up for via the web.</p><p></li><li>Matt told an amusing story about an old boss that had to go to jail every night after work. He then went on to tear apart an electric bouncing ball. When he threw it down the hall, it wouldn&rsquo;t stop blinking!</p><p></li><li>Longest meeting ever!</p><p></li></ol></p></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
