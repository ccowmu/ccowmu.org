We&rsquo;re looking for officers to go to the auction and try to get us good stuff.</p><p></li><li>Web site status. It looks pretty good but is still an ongoing process. If you want to add content or help out contact Wes (<a href=mailto:pacd@yakko.cs.wmich.edu><a href=mailto:pacd@yakko.cs.wmich.edu>pacd@yakko.cs.wmich.edu</a></a>).</p><p></li><li>If you have suggestions for the fliers, contact Rodger.</p><p></li><li>What&rsquo;s up with WIDR? Isaac put up some stats for them and Wes also contacted them. Apparently we have a Dell for us somewhere. We just have to toss Windows on it and we&rsquo;ll be set&mldr; right&mldr;<center><p><b>Wakko has been up for 25 whole days!!!</b></p></center></p><p></li><li>Anyone want to learn Python to change mailman so that it will send a link to go to to get your password instead of having it mail you your password in plain text once every month? Wes said he&rsquo;ll take a look. Erik (me) is thinking of looking at it too.</p><p></li><li>T-shirt pricing: If we want more than twelve we can go to Spirit Shop for $8.50 per T-shirt. T-Shirt Printing Inc. can get them for ~$11.50 for a couple of dozen. Ten days after the art is approved for delivery so we need to act before next Thursday.</p><p></li><li>John suggested we get another DNS entry pointed at Yakko. How about it? Every let us know what you think (<a href=mailto:officers@yakko.cs.wmich.edu><a href=mailto:officers@yakko.cs.wmich.edu>officers@yakko.cs.wmich.edu</a></a>).</p><p></li><li>Battle of the T-shirts. There are two basic designs for the T-shirt and we took a secret vote and decided the winning logo: Isaac&rsquo;s logo!</p><p></li><li>We have a UPS for Yakko now!</p></li></ol></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
