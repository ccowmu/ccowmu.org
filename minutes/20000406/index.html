This will happen at a time determined in last weeks minutes. I looked it up. It is April 21 at 7:00 p.m. Directions are as follows:</p><p>Location: 626 Summer Street Time: Approx 7:00 pm Date: Friday, April 21st Considerations: - Pleaes park in the street (not the driveway) - bring your own beverages (alcohol, pop, tea, whatever)&ndash;we may pick up some 2 liters but I can&rsquo;t gurantee it -pizza will be provided - the movies selection is up in the air (look for something sci-fi) Directions: From downtown: Take Kalamazoo avenue West (away from BL-94 towards US-131), keep in the right lane. The road forks, take it right (you&rsquo;re now on Douglas), hang a left at the stop light (you are now on North), take a left on the first street, which is Summer St. The house is 3rd on the left, grey, kind of big and crappy looking. From Campus: Take Stadium towards downtown, keep left. Get in the lane that goes to Elm Crossover and take that over to Elm. Take elm north and then hang a left on Kalamzoo ave (see above for the rest of the story). Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t get a real map drawn&mldr; there was just no time (you can probably pull one up on mapquest if you need it). 2. One strand of Christmas lights work.</p><p></li><li>Do we buy a print cartridge&mldr;.yes! Will we buy it from a spammer??? No!!! We have resolved to buy a print cartridge for our Epson Stylus Color Printer at a slightly more expensive price than that of the spammer. 4. Reminder: SETI at Home is not allowed on Yakko. Action will be taken if it is found running.</p><p></li><li>We are attempting to get some 486 DX 33. We can take some off of his hand. Some of them need to go to good homes. We are to refurbish a system and give it away to someone who can&rsquo;t afford a computer. Talk to zrodger for more info. 6. Magoo has been talking to the founders of the computer club and Yakko. They are interested in putting together a presentation. More info to come. If anyone is interested in contributing some of their experiences e-mail <a href=mailto:magoo@yakko.cs.wmich.edu>magoo@yakko.cs.wmich.edu</a>.</p><p></li><li>Major Domo? It is starting to come together.</p><p></li><li>Elections: President: Wes Vice President: Matt Treasurer: Ed Secretary: Erik Finance: Rodger Sysadmin: Ed is temporary acting sysadmin until someone else is found. Web Master: Izak Publicity: Cabe34</p><p></li><li>Major Domo works now!!
