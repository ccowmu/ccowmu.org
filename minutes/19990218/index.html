Last summer we had a hacker and a spat with the UCC. IN an effort to look more responsible we set up process accounting on yakko, basically a log of every command by users on yakko. Then in a security breach we could find out who has been doing what. Anyhow - the key was an audit trail. So, ozz zipped it and asks to set up a cron job to kill them in a reasonable time. Maybe 6 months.</p><p>Isaac announces a new member - procrastinated till after the N-cube visit.</p><p></p><p>Chicago trip is set for an all day trip Saturday March 6th.</p><p>Tentative</p><p>Isaac, Tim, Pacd, Olorun.</p><p>Finances:</p><p>Cash Box 161.84.
