It was today, June 28th, at 6:32 PM that we began seemingly on time. Albeit Dan, our president was late, extremely late and Tim was nowhere to be found. Only a feat that drc usually tackles with the naked eye - aligning bits perpendicularly. Dan enters the glory filled room with a smirk on his face.
