Anyway,
it&rsquo;s plugged in now.<p></p><p>2> We really need keys to this building<br>Eric also needs help with the office.<p></p><p>3> Presentation switcheroo<br>Tim bailed out due to excessive studying.
Chris offered to do a voip-asterisk.
Eric offered to do GTK programming.
Other topics were suggested. If you would like to present on something, send
email on officers.<p></p><p>4> Lan party - Nov. 6th at Parkview Campus<br>Room is reserved from friday to saturday midnight. $5 preregister, $10 at
door. We haven&rsquo;t officially got permission from the dean, yet, but John is
covering that.<p></p><p>When should we start advertising? Permission is a prerequisite. We&rsquo;ll have to
do a detailed inventory, so they can&rsquo;t accuse us of breaking stuff.
Apparently, this was a problem with the last lan party, even though what they
accused us of breaking was noticed a week after the party.<p></p><p>5> WIDR is po&rsquo;ed about the WIDR stream.<br>We can&rsquo;t really do anything about the VLAN situation, but some discussion was
made about feeding the stream to a machine in Parkview from a machine in the
office.<p></p><p>6> Adjourned at 6:30.<p></p></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
