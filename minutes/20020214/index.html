We need an apache book. We are having some issues with the web server. We also need, Make, Programming Perl, C/C++ Oreilly Books. Doesn&rsquo;t everybody love O&rsquo;Reilley books? We also need a kernel book. I just spelled that two different ways, which is correct? I think we need a Windows machine. Zaphod blew me off.
