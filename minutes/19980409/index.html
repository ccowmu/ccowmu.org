<a href=/minutes/ class=back-link>‚Üê Back to All Minutes</a></div></header><div class=article-content><p>People here: Paul, Dennis, Tim, Sean, Steve, Wes, Darron, Ozz, Isaac & Rebecca; the late comer: Kelly/Nike .</p><p>Issue One: Wes&rsquo;s First time presiding. He can be reached through info by the light switch in the office. He says, &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;</p><p>Issue Two: Pizza party next week. Meet in room #3512 Knauss. Email <a href=mailto:tmiley@yakko.cs.wmich.edu>tmiley@yakko.cs.wmich.edu</a> if you wanna go. Movies will be shown: Hackers, and Star Trek VI. Hackers will be shown first. [You must RSVP Tim by Wed, if not: you no go!]</p><p>Issue Three: For the yakko upgrade, we purchased: AMD-K6 233MHz We would still like a CD-burner, a new monitor&mldr; etc.</p><p>Issue Four: Firewall? We think we might need one?</p><p>Issue Five: The web page, is lame. We need to update it. Volunteers? New Logo? Isaac would like to try. Advertise URL around campus.</p><p>Issue Six: CS web pages need neat stuff. JAVA stuff? Assorted Pretty things? Should UPE be helping us? Let&rsquo;s ask them. At any rate, the CS pages <em>need</em> work. Deadline: Soon.</p><p>Issue Seven: Cookies := { Purest Evil }</p><p>Issue Eight: Ozz := { Dan Quale | Flack Taker }</p><p>Issue Nine: IRC should be moved to Peoples home machines. Win32 versions would probably be better anyway. People who don&rsquo;t have their own PC&rsquo;s shouldn&rsquo;t worry. People with their own machines, should however, make an attempt to keep it in the home. Upload Free-ware Win32 IRC programs to the Yakko pub FTP site.</p><p></p></p><p>Adjourned: 18:41 mEST.</p><p></p></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
