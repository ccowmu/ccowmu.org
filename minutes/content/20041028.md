CCLUB meeting for 10/28/04<br>
Members present: Eric, Joe, Tim, Brian, Miles<p>

1> The radio was reset<br>
WIDR stream had static.<p>

2> Eric was slapped for mentioning Gentoo.<br>
Update requests were made for PHP to be upgraded to the newest version.  The
general consensus was that it's not doable at this time.<p>

3> Lan party<br>
Tournaments will be for Doom 3 and UT2k4.  16 player double elimination.  It
will be tight, so we will need dedicated servers to be running the whole time.
Prizes will include $50 gift cards for Best Buy.  It might be crazy due to the
time constraints.  Brian has developed a time structure.  Joe asks for a copy
of the schedule.<p>

Brian would like to offer a intranet site for people to register their
teams.<p>

Tim, Brian and Eric made flyers.  The flyers were submitted to OSL.  They have
a stupid 24 hour rule, so it will be available at noon.  We will meet in the
office at 2:00 on Friday.  Tim, Joe and Brian are going to meet in the
office.<p>

Also, we are on The BroncoWeb and Psycho Rage.  We need to post a map on yakko
for off campus people and those who may not be familiar with the Parkview
Campus.<p>

4> Sighs of relief were heard when Chris arrived.<p>

5> Adjourned at 6:34 PM.<p>
