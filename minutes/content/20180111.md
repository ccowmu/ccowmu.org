### BonzAI Brawl

- During the second weekend in April, MTU will be putting on an AI development competition.

- This a basic AI competition that would be easy enough for all levels of programming knowledge.

- The idea is for us to just compete remotely from our campus and digitally submit our work.

- Dr. Carr would like us to get 4-5 teams of 2-3 people together so that we can setup a competition environment here.

- The BonzAI API is java and that would be the main programming language for the competition.

### Linux Library

- Typo has ordered a large amount of 16gb flash drives for club.

- The idea is that we can have ready to go bootable flash drive of many different Distros of Linux and other OSs to assist with getting PCs ready for classes and other OS related projects


### The Door Swipe

- The positive factor of the door swipe would be allowing members to access club as freely as they please.

- Unfortunately this has great downsides such as Losing autonomy in controlling room access(probably forever) to campus safety, Cost of around $1000, and it would also be non transferable if for whatever reason the club was relocated. 

- Those who were present at club voted to not get the door swipe access, but we did not feel that those present at club represent a majority of current club members so we will make google forms or other online ballot for those who did not attend to vote.

- For now you can message in officer if the door is locked when you arrive. Alternatively you can call the office phone by [clicking here](https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu/office/)


### Spring Book Buy 

- Club is doing a book buy in the upcoming months.

- If you have any books or other materials that would benefit you or the club with computer relate projects, please mention it in the officers room in the chat.
