### Advertisement for PLAN and Club

- Article for advertisement for this semester: Business cards, Fliers, Table banners

- For business cards we believe that vista print is the best option as they are $9 for 500 cards (For first time users) 

- We are going to to the banner printing resource on campus which will cost about $20 per table banner.

- We will need fliers to post for PLAN that we can make ourselves that will cost about $10 for printing.

- We vote to allocate the $40 to PLAN Advertisment that will be handled by kami
