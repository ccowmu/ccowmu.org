# Western Student Association

- Cade Gillem (cpg) is reaching out to technology RSOs to connect them with WSA, Western Michigan University's student government.
- WSA gives students the opportunity to represent their colleges and RSOs and connect with university administration. Computer Club has chosen its WSA senator, but there are currently a few open spots in the senate to represent the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
- If you are interested in becoming a senator, apply at [westernstudentassociation.org](http://westernstudentassociation.org/legislative/senate/).
- All Registered Student Organizations are also allowed funding for events (under a certain set of restrictions). Talk to cpg or browse [westernstudentassociation.org](http://westernstudentassociation.org/funding/allocations) with any ideas for Computer Club events to fund.
