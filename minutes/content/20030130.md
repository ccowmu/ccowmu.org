1. If the club doesn't secure a new office in Kohrman Hall, there is a chance that we could be withouat an office once the space here in Dunbar is reallocated </p><p>
2. It seems that there was a presentation yesterday about an embedded platform that was mostly software related. We are thinking about setting up a mailman account so that we will be notified of any and all presentations that will interest the members of the computer club. Efforts will be made to increase ties between engineering and computer science here on campus. We will try to find the presenter to see if it would be possible to have the presentation given here.  </p><p>
3. The new chair, Dr. Guizani will be going away for about a week. When he gets back we will try to schedule a meeting so that he can see what the club can offer the engineering departrment. </p><p>
