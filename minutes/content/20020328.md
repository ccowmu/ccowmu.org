Members Present: Lots </p><p>
1. Speaker, we're waiting till next semester we guess... </p><p>
2. Status of Yakko: It's ZIF socket melted and there was a psychedelic  dreamshow and now we're stuck with unteryakko until we get a new mobo and ram (potentially), and a new CPU. </p><p>
The debate now is whether our replacement board will be a dual-Athlon board. The consensus seems to be against getting a dual-Athlon board because it'd be a waste of our money. </p><p>
3. Books, 5 have come in and the Apache book order was cancelled.  All others are confirmed. </p><p>
4. Presentation schedule is on our <a href="http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu"> homepage</a>. </p>
