# Merchandise
- Adding somewhat of a web store to our website.

- We will also have current inventory stock listed.

# Noise Complaints
- Make sure we are keeping the volume down in the room when there are a lot of us in here.
 We have received noise complaints from the surrounding classrooms lately.
- Remember that this room is always at risk of being taken over, since it is not protected by the CS department. Please keep this in mind.
