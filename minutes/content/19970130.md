We need scripts, ideas, people etc. 	Thinking about promoting linux and possibly selling the commercial on 	VHS tapes to others. 	   Ideas:  		1) feuding laptop...Win 95, Linux, etc 		2) Office worker rubbing fellow co-worker about being 		   done with his project because he was using Linux 	Write your script in any old text file and send it to the Jay or the C-Club, 	act it out at the next meeting, do what ever...it's totally open to suggestion. </p><p>
