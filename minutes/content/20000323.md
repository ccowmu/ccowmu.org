 6. Everyone thank Ed for setting up NFS and NIS to allow     login to Dot, Wakko, and Yakko. </p><p>
 7. Net-link webpages have apparently ceased to function.     Does this mean we might be able to get our webpages     back?  Ralph will try to find out what happened to     the server.  wmich.com is down.   * We are making a motion to buy wmich.com if it becomes     available, or maybe get our own domain name if not. </p><p>
 8. Zanny supposedly has an idea to help us make money by     setting up majordomo and clubs who want to use the     mail server, possibly by paying a yearly Computer Club     membership, etc.  Tim will try it out on Dot first. </p><p>
