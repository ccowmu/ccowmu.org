The open ssh connection to yakko was noticed which led to a security emergency and OIT contacted the Computer Science department to ask for yakko to be removed from the network on the 3rd of April.</li><li>giggles had a meeting with the Director of IT at the College of Arts and Sciences and was told that two of the passwords he gave were incorrect due to them accidentally being swapped.</li><li>giggles was then able to help them reaccess their file servers on April 5th.</li><li>The OIT investigation was extended because yakko was misconfigured and did not have logs at the time of the investigation.</li></ul></li><li>The full report written by giggles can be found at: <a href=https://gist.github.com/blakewrege/0da98dc1ed1b58efdbc47af820d48633>https://gist.github.com/blakewrege/0da98dc1ed1b58efdbc47af820d48633</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=nominations>Nominations</h3><ul><li>Before we started the nominations, kami has made a suggestion for the future officers to create an Alumni Ambassador position which could act as a mediator between alumni and students.</li><li>President Nominations: sgtsarcasm, kahrl, dolphin, cpg, and leech.</li><li>Vice President Nominations: zurek, dolphin, mobyte, sgtsarcasm, leech, and hellbacon.</li><li>Treasurer Nominations: tank, dolphin, twitch, mobyte, yillivs, and kharl.</li><li>VP of Finance Nominations: leech and kahrl.</li><li>Secretary Nominations: mobyte, hellbacon, and cookie.</li><li>At next week&rsquo;s meeting, the elections will be held.<ul><li>If you would like to submit an absentee vote, please try to contact a Computer Club officer through Facebook, the backup IRC server, or Slack.</li></ul></li><li>Each candidate will present a speech at the elections as usual and there will be a discussion before voting for each position.</li><li>Good luck to all of the nominees!</li></ul><blockquote><p>Meeting ends at 6:58 PM</p></blockquote></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
