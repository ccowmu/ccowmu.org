The speed of the activity determines how paid. Paid for each correct screen. The program has to allow the subject to play game for 5 minutes. Program probably needs to be done on Windows or Unix environments, unless Mac is possible. Programmer will be responsible for making the program that stops the simulation periodically to offer to let the subject play the game. The game must play for either 5 minutes, or until the subject stops the game. Interested programming students may contact Grainne Matthews at 349-2314.</p><p></li><li>Phone Bryan asks if we should kill the phone.
