Any ideas for an itinerary contact Tim. Right now it looks as though it may be a do what you want party fest. The majority idea is that structure sucks, everyone for themselves.</p><p></li><li>Wiley&mldr;Is that you? -Couldn&rsquo;t do the NIS thing. So Wiley is mounted to yakko such that everyone who has an account on yakko, can log onto wiley using their yakko account. -Wiley is a Pentium 100 machine with 32 megs of memory. -Can only change password on Yakko, can&rsquo;t do it on wiley. -If you notice any errors while on wiley, please email root with a description of the problem.</p><p></li><li>History: -Looking to generate a history of the Computer Club. Anyone who has aspirations in researching ground breaking accomplishments or divulging past C-Club actions of members contact Tim. Don&rsquo;t worry, plausible deny-ability will be accepted.</p><p></li><li>Constitution: Tim still wants to ratify the old constitution and bring it more up to date. Who, what, when and where has yet to be established.</p><p></li><li>Meeting ended 6:45 pm.</p><p></li></ol></p><p></p></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
