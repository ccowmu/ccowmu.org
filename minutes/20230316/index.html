We will need help administrating the event and grading tests.</p><h2 id=hackathon>Hackathon</h2><p>Next weekend (03/26) is Hackathon. It will be in the Bernhard Center West Ballroom 8am-8pm (or thereabouts).</p><p>We would like to do class visits next week to promote Hackathon. Let alu know if you are available to do so and flyers will be provided.</p><p>The budget for Hackathon will be submitted tonight so we can get money from WSA.</p><h2 id=giving-day>Giving Day</h2><p>Giving Day is on 04/12. People will be able to donate through RSOs.</p><h2 id=money-talk>Money Talk</h2><p>We have two portions of money that the Dean&rsquo;s Office owes us. Giving Day money from last year, and a reimbursement for Science Olympiad. The Dean&rsquo;s Office was confused about Science Olympiad reimbursement receipts and would like to provide us purchasing power directly instead. The Giving Day money is sitting in a bank account run by the Dean&rsquo;s Office, so we&rsquo;ll need to contact them if we want to spend it.</p><p>We also owe $300 to the university library because they accepted a package for us. To settle this debt, our options are to transfer money through the WMU account or to write a paper check. kahrl gave a wonderful talk about how banks work, but the important part is that paying our debts through the university makes things much easier for us.</p><p>$500 would remain as Dean&rsquo;s Office money after our debt is cleared. The WSA is expected to provide us money for renting the Bernhard Center for Hackathon, but if not, we&rsquo;ll pay through the Dean&rsquo;s Office.</p><h2 id=fall-registration>Fall Registration</h2><p>Fall registration is now open for seniors. Walk-in advising is available for College of Engineering students.</p><p>The last day to withdraw from a class is 03/20.</p><h2 id=student-success-hub>Student Success Hub</h2><p>The Student Success Hub launched today.
