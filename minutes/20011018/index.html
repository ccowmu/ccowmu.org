You can go there and enter your username and stuff and change your info. Click this <a href=http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/members/>link</a>. Now we need suggestions for services to put on the members page to get people to use this feature. Webmail, web-based news reader, etc. Go to the member page, check it out, and let us know what you think.</p><p></li><li>Radar Love &ndash; when two radars love each other very much. So what is Jungle Love? You get Jungle Fever from Jungle Love and Jungle Love is what happens after Jungle Boogie&mldr; Will Radar Love work in the Jungle? Yes it will.</p><p></li><li>We have a project mailing list created. People were put on it. Go to <a href=http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/mailman/listinfo/><a href=http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/mailman/listinfo/>http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/mailman/listinfo/</a></a>and click on the link if you want to be involved. Wes is coordinating the projects.</p><p></li><li>Another idea thrown out again was putting our website into CVS.</p><p></li><li>We need to make a list of things to be done. On Yakko, the web board, etc. Projects, system administration tasks, etc. Broadcasting our meetings would be pretty sweet too. Webpage stats was another idea.</p><p></li><li>Do we want separate mailing lists for web people, lists for individual projects? We should have a separate list for people working on the webpage and Matt will contact KLUG about setting up lists so people can&rsquo;t get on a project list without first getting on the main project list first.</p><p></li><li>Isaac had a G3 donated to him and he offered to lend it to us to put linux on it as a learning experience. Neat.</p><p></li><li>6:42pm &ndash; Pizza arrived.</p><p></li><li>Do we want an AS/400 to play with? Lots of people think it would be neat to play with. Let&rsquo;s do it!!!</p><p></li><li>Treasurer&rsquo;s Report: $40 in cash on hand. $403.25 in the bank.</p><p></li><li>The pizza is good.</p></li></ol></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2025 CCaWMU</p></div></footer></body></html>
