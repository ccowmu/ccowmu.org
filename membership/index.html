    <p>What is really offered by cclub cannot be summarized by this or any list. When I joined a year ago, 
    I had no idea what to expect, and having been involved I can say easily that this is the best thing that I've been involved with
    since I joined WMU. The rate at which I learned by being surrounded by engaged, knowledgeable peers is incomparable to anything I've experienced in any of my classes.
    
    Its my personal goal to make your time at WMU as meaningful as mine.
    
    Hope to meet you,
