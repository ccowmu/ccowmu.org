    <p class="indent"> What is really offered by cclub cannot be
    summarized by this or any list. When I joined I had pretty low
    expectations, and having been involved I can say easily, and honestly, that
    this is the best thing that I've been involved with since I came to
    WMU. The rate at which I learned by being surrounded by engaged,
    knowledgeable peers is incomparable to anything I've experienced in any of
    my classes and I often hear the same from my peers.
