    <h1>Membership</h1>
    <p>Join us at our meetings, 6pm Thursday on <a href="https://meet.google.com/yua-pkby-rbg">Google Meet</a>.
    The price for a yearly membership is $10. <br/>
    <br/>
    When you join you can get access to:
 </p>

   
    <ul>
        <li>Awesome Job Networking</li>
        <li>An account on our chat service to keep in touch with both current members and helpful alumni</li>
        <li>Access to our tools, servers, and educational resources</li>
    </ul>

     <p> You can pay in cash or via <a href="https://www.paypal.me/cclub"> Paypal</a> to cclubtreasurer@gmail.com </p>
     
    <p> What is really offered by cclub cannot be
    summarized by this or any list. When I joined I had pretty low
    expectations, and having been involved I can say easily, and honestly, that
    this is the best thing that I've been involved with since I came to
    WMU. The rate at which I learned by being surrounded by engaged,
    knowledgeable peers is incomparable to anything I've experienced in any of
    my classes and I often hear the same from my peers.
