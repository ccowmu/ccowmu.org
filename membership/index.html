        <li>Web hosting</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent"> What is really offered by cclub cannot be
    summarized by this or any list. When I joined I had pretty low
    expectations, and having been involved I can say easily, and honestly, that
    this is the best thing that I've been involved with since I came to
    WMU.</p>
    <p>The rate at which I learned by being surrounded by engaged,
    knowledgeable peers is incomparable to anything I've experienced in any of
    my classes and I often hear the same from my peers.</p>
    <p>Its my personal goal to make your time at WMU as meaningful as mine has
    been as a result of this organization.</p>
    <p>Hope to meet you,</p>
    <p>Flay <br> President <br> CCoWMU </p>
