Blacktops

Sold some MSPs today
Unkown number where sold, not a lot
We will likely have to sell more next week
Students may have to return to purchase blacktops as well
Stryker is &ldquo;booked until March&rdquo; No date was given
We may not be able to rely on them to fab the boards
Kahrl and aerospice have been looking into stenciling the SMT components to do it manually
Unfortunately work that was done on the small blacktop parts did not work as well as we were hoping
Buyback has been established at $30, we may lose money on this one.
May move to JLCPCB for future fabrications
Dr. Gupta may send out email to alumni let them know we are looking for blacktop buybacks

The Failed Coup

The coup from last week has failed
The revolutionaries were crushed

STEM Fair

Febuary 9th in the Bernhard Center in the Ballroom from 10am to 1pm, virtual is 3-6pm
Employers may be different at both so it may be worth going to both
Online requires registration

Denso coming back

Cafe Critque is a good way for resume critiquing
Hiring managers will come talk to you about how to make your resume better
You will want to bring a printed out version of your resume
You can also email your resume to wmuhandshake@wmich.edu and have it reviewed that way
In person is generally recommended for better feedback

Career Zone

Career zone is open and is good for resume critques
They will try to help you find internships or jobs after graduation
Always a good idea to get your resume reviewed

Pi Day

March 14
It is a big fundraiser day for all RSOs through engineering department
All money that is donated during that event goes straight to RSO
A pie eating contest is also being pushed very heavily
There are prizes depending on donations
If you know someone who wants to donate please let them know

Student Events

Open houses for students that are already incoming to Western.
One upcoming one is for Honors College students in particular
Scott is out with COVID so we may have a bit of a delay in what we need
1/28 has a bunch of new students, so be nice to them

Western Weekend

WMU holding new event on April 2nd, this is a Saturday
We don&rsquo;t really know what it is but we should be prepared to participate, it may be a recruiting event
It will be held at the bernhard

Science Olympiad

Weekend of March 19
Middle and High Schoolers will be taken to Western to do small science projects
Our event will be called &ldquo;WiFi Lab&rdquo;
This is the first time we will be doing this event.
You get a free tshirt for showing up and working

Blacktops

Kharl is putting together manufacturting plan with Stryker for blacktops
These should really help students in 2230
We will have to make choice on how many we need to make
80 will be need to cover this semester and summer classes, 140 will be needed for adding fall semester
Semi Conducter shortage is making this quite a bit harder than it should be.
Many circuit boards have already been made but we need to populate boards with parts
There is a lot of decision making that needs to be made in #officers for this decision
Stryker has been very useful in this project
Stryker is using newer pick and place robots that need a new file format that KiCad does not produce
Kharl should be able to send new panel design to Stryker
Hopefully Stryker should be able to complete board manufacturing automatically as well.
Will need to do another solder party to solder and test boards.

Synth

We are currently building a modular synth
This is an analog synth that is composed of multiple modules to generate music
They are generally put into a rack similar to a server, allowing you to hook the signal generators and modifiers together to make interesting sounds
We should start putting it together soon.
It would be cool to take it to Bronco Bash and show new students music that was made by a machine club built

Lockpick Set

Flay will be sending us a new lockpicking kit so we can teach lockpicking again

Hackathon

Hosting hackathon in early April

Migration

We are currently working on migrating chat, vault, website, and wiki.
After chat is moved we will wipe dot, allowing us to host other stuff using the machine
Waiting for ccawmu.org domain transfer from typo, for now he can manually enter DNS records
Migration is going to server on Linode instead of locally.
We may be able to request money from school to pay for costs.

Linux Install Party

Next week we will be doing a Linux install party.
This is a very good idea for any students in 2230 or 3240
This is a good idea for any other students that are not in 2230 or 3240 as well.

Academic Integrity Committee Member Needed

The AIC basically make the final verdict on cheating/misconduct charges
As a member you would:

Regularly serve on five-member Academic Integrity Hearing Panels (AHIPs), each composed of three faculty members and two students, to hear charges of academic dishonesty and determine whether the charges have merit.  (These hearings are currently taking place virtually until further notice.)


Provide a minimum of 6 business hours per week (8am-5pm, Monday-Friday) of general availability to serve on AIHPs in 2&#43; hour blocks of time.  Panelists are assigned to AIHPs based on their availability and are notified approximately one week in advance by email if they have been scheduled to serve.  They are sent hearing information to review before they arrive.
Attend a virtual training session on Thursday, February 4 or Friday, February 5.
Based on past statistics, each student would serve an average of 2-3 times per year

WSA

We need to do an orientation for WSA to secure funding for them
We could possibly use the funding to buy better software (ex. ida pro) or a better 3D Printer
If theres any software or something else that you think club should allocate the money for  message someone on the Eboard

PLAN

Friday(7/28) at 6 there will be a metting for planning a PLAN plan schedule.
We also need to talk to the past years sponsors and make sure that funding is secured and they they are taken care of.

MHACKS

MHACkS is coming up in september 22-24
Free if you apply(https://mhacks.org/login)
Things attendies may need to think about is money for gas and possibly thinking about getting a near by hotel room as sleeping spots are not garuanteed
Kessler and dolfin went last year so if the website does not answer your questions they might be able to help.

Dolfin&rsquo;s idea

Dolfin would also like to start a project to build an IRC server with one of our boxes
Contact dolfin if you are interested in heloing eith this or have experince in in such projects.

General

Riot just got updated(Can now un-ban people)
A git library created by Mdlayher is going to be used for automatically backing up our servers (yakko, jazz, dot, etc&hellip;)

Hellbacons words on server upgrades

We should hold off on upgrading DOT&rsquo;s the RAM until after bench marking.
After bench marking we can better see where the bottleneck is at.
Redmine cclub.cs.wmich.edu/redmine Log in with your cclub credentials(http://www.redmine.org/)

General

Typo suggests we should make a Textbook library for the club whether it be web-hosted or on a USB
Form of library will depend in the legality of an online form
Strongth was wondering about a club software project let him know if you have any questions or ideas
August 11th will be the date for switch completely to a Riot/Vector/Matrix chat service.
We still need to set a meeting days for PLAN meetings.

Road towards plan

Date is set for the 11th and 12th of November
We need to work on setting up a committy for that

Server updates

Adding 32Ram DOT (our future VM server) would cost around $370
That would allow us to offer 3GB RAM/VM
We will be reappplying Thermal paste to  Wakko
also we could use a new heatsink and a fan for it  costing $60

General

We are reistered for bronco bash
Sgt is the official VP of OPS
We have to look at passport day more

Kahrl is leaving

Kahrl will be going to New Mexico
If you need to reach him his email is f.allin.kahrl@wmich.edu

Paypal

Name on the club Paypal account needs to be changed if we want to get commercial use out of if.
We will need this done to do things like swipe credit cards at plan.
Tank and Kahrl are currently working on this issue

PLAN Fall 2017

We need to start looking for plan sponsors.
We also need to set a date.
We are looking for volunteers to help run events and concessions

Passport day

Usually happens a week before the semester.
Good opportunity to draw new members to club
We should unify as a club as to what chat to use before this day so we can send a clear message to new members
We are looking for volunteers to help with this event

Positions

We are still looking for webmaster and VP of finance
Let an eboard member know if you are interested

Server related issues

The plan is to put OpenStack on jazz.
Every shell account would be given its own instance with nothing else on the instance.
VPS access can be provided on SysAdmin approval(hellbacon)
We should think about getting more RAM for system which would upgrade it to 64GB
I am talking to hellbacon about putting out an official updated State of the Server

IRC?

The thought is that we should reinstate irc on our servers as our club chat
Is there any objection?
Switching chats in the summer might not stick.
Irc is a good long term solution.
Slack has its perks such as ease of use for new memeber.

Talk to WSA

We should persue the WSA for funding to have alumni to come talk in Cclub
Dr. Carr will be making contact with alumni this July

Stringy can get new switches for the server that are better than those currently affixed.

Wakko on top of Yakko is stable. And is now hosting a chat client called riot.
Login to the new chat:
- in browser search cclub.cs.wmich.edu/vector

Yakko Server Status

For the last two weeks, the Computer Club yakko server has not had access to Western Michigan University&rsquo;s network.
Earlier today there was a meeting with Jason Johnson about the conditions needed for yakko to be re-added to the network.

stringy, typo, sphinx, flay, hellbacon, and kami were our representatives at the meeting.


There were some requirements set for the server to be reconnected to the network (These rules will apply to all servers in the Computer Science network).

Jason Johnson will have a sudo account with all privileges.

This condition has already been met and he now has a local sudo account.


Logging will be used on the server.

Due to missing logs at the time of the incident, we would need to make sure logging is working in order for the Computer Science department network to remain secure.


A list of all sudoers on yakko with phone numbers and contact information will be supplied to Jason Johnson.

This list will be required to always be up to date.
This is to test for security on a weekly basis.


A list of ports and services used by the server will be supplied.


A formal document describing the requirements for this policy will be available soon.
This policy will be given to us and to all other server owners on the Computer Science network in order for the department to keep their network secure.
This policy was put in place to prevent any similar situations from happening in the future.
The reason the investigation details were not known at first was because information could not be risked to be given to the person that was responsible for the server security issues.
It is hopeful that very soon the server will be brought back online after all of these requests are properly met.
We would like to thank the support of Computer Club members, Dr. Trenary, and Dr. Carr for helping us get through this situation.

Why the Server Was Down

As it turns out, the actions of giggles accidently caused yakko to be temporarily removed from the Western Michigan University network.

It started when giggles was fired from his job at the Geosciences department without being given a chance to transfer administrator accounts to his replacement on the 31st of March.
In an attempt to resolve this issue, giggles accessed the Geosciences servers through an established ssh connection from yakko to transfer information to College of Arts and Sciences Technology Services on the 2nd of April.
Due to an Active Directory Administrator password being changed by Geosciences, their entire file server was rendered inaccessible. The open ssh connection to yakko was noticed which led to a security emergency and OIT contacted the Computer Science department to ask for yakko to be removed from the network on the 3rd of April.
giggles had a meeting with the Director of IT at the College of Arts and Sciences and was told that two of the passwords he gave were incorrect due to them accidentally being swapped.
giggles was then able to help them reaccess their file servers on April 5th.
The OIT investigation was extended because yakko was misconfigured and did not have logs at the time of the investigation.


The full report written by giggles can be found at: https://gist.github.com/blakewrege/0da98dc1ed1b58efdbc47af820d48633.

Nominations

Before we started the nominations, kami has made a suggestion for the future officers to create an Alumni Ambassador position which could act as a mediator between alumni and students.
President Nominations: sgtsarcasm, kahrl, dolphin, cpg, and leech.
Vice President Nominations: zurek, dolphin, mobyte, sgtsarcasm, leech, and hellbacon.
Treasurer Nominations: tank, dolphin, twitch, mobyte, yillivs, and kharl.
VP of Finance Nominations: leech and kahrl.
Secretary Nominations: mobyte, hellbacon, and cookie.
At next week&rsquo;s meeting, the elections will be held.

If you would like to submit an absentee vote, please try to contact a Computer Club officer through Facebook, the backup IRC server, or Slack.


Each candidate will present a speech at the elections as usual and there will be a discussion before voting for each position.
Good luck to all of the nominees!

Server

kami has informed us that the server could possibly be back soon after an internal incident has happened.
For the time that our server is down, anyone is welcome to join us on slack at: https://ccawmu.slack.com/join.
The situation is currently being taken care of and more details will come soon.
Until that happens, it has been requested that everyone stays calm and avoids overreacting to any rumors.
It has been requested:

Do not attempt to force any individuals to give you information.
Do not attempt to force any individuals to take action.
Do not assume any speculation as fact.
Do not take action into your own hands.
Do not be insulting to any other individuals.
Do not attribute speculation as fact to the names of any individuals, inside or outside of Computer Club.
To remember to respect all members within and outside of this club.
To remain calm and be patient.


If any of these requests are not respected, action may be taken by the Computer Club executive board.
While this situation is being resolved, we must trust kami, Dr. Trenary, and Dr. Carr as they handle the situation.
Many people during the meeting shared their thoughts on this situation. Their thoughts, feelings, and support are greatly valued.

Dynatrace Talk

On March 2nd (two weeks from now) at the meeting, representatives from Dynatrace will be coming to Computer Club to give a free talk.
The topic is currently unknown but it should be an interesting talk for anyone that wants to attend.

Science Olympiad

On February 25th, Computer Club volunteers will be meeting will be at the Bernhard Center for 30 minutes before the Science Olympiad event for registering.
The plan is to meet at 12:30 PM in the Bernhard Center, Room 105.
It would be ideal for volunteers to arrive before 12:30 because registration may take around 10 minutes and set up for the computers will be need to be done before the event starts at 1 PM.
All of the materials are ready, but volunteers will be needed.

In addition to the people that volunteered from last week (kami, stringy, Steve Johnson, hellbacon, pasportit, strongth, and zurek), kell has also volunteered.
It is likely that only between 5 and 6 people will be needed for help.


The event will last an hour long, so people volunteering to be judges should be prepared to be there for the entirety of the event.

Oculus Rift

zurek has 3D printed some mounts to hold the Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch on the wall.

This is to prevent any damage to the headset or the controllers.
It is also preferred to keep the cable off the ground so it is not damaged by being rolled over by chairs.
Please be careful with this technology and use the holders on the wall next to the monitor to preserve the lifespan of the Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch.


Additionally, we are going to buy a third sensor for the Oculus Rift so it can provide more accurate tracking.

This will cost $79 and strongth has informed us that this is affordable in our budget.


We&rsquo;re also buying googly eyes to put on the front of the Rift.

Richard Stallman Talk

The recording of the Richard Stallman talk from January 30th is now available at: https://vimeo.com/kalamazoocollege/review/203166957/41490a2135.
It is a great talk to watch if you want to know more about free software and privacy.

Interview Prep

pasportit and strongth are doing some interview preparation activities tomorrow at noon in the Computer Club office.
This can be a great opportunity to learn more about the skills needed to have a successful job interview for a Computer Science career, so anyone interested is encouraged to come.

Vice President Nominations

We will need a new Vice President of Computer Club for the next two months after nospace has stepped down.
The person to be elected for this position will assist kami in any Computer Club responsibilities and will need to provide assistance with organizing and setting up PLAN for the Spring 2017 semester.
The election will be next week, so everyone has the time between now and next Thursday to consider who they want to vote for.
If you would like to submit an absentee ballot, please contact an officer on IRC.
The following people have been nominated for the position of Vice President:

leech
zurek
dolphin
sgtsarcasm
mobyte

Spring 2017 Semester

We welcome everyone to the new semester!
Hopefully everyone had a great Winter Break and we are looking forward to everything that will be happening this semester.

IRC

IRC will soon be password protected in order to limit spam or unauthorized IRC usage.

This will eventually take effect, but not immediately in order to allow people to become aware of this change and to update their IRC bots.
It may be about 10 days until we are moved over to this new IRC server.



Scholarship

The President and Vice President of Computer Club will now earn $500 each semester toward their tuition.
This has gone into effect last semester and it will be used for the foreseeable future.
Thanks to flay, sphinx, and Dr. Carr.

Email Server

drc needs funding for our email server.
If you can help, please let him know on IRC.
Digital Ocean VPS can be used to refer towards our email system.

PLAN

Volunteers:

nospace, kami, zurek, ohaimark, strongth, kell, stringy, mobyte.


The current tentative date for PLAN is April 8th.
The first PLAN meeting will be this Friday at 5 PM in order to start organizing what we need to do.

CTF Class

nospace is now the professor of the CTF class for this semester.
The time is currently listed at 2 PM on the WMU class directory but the time is going to be moved to 3 PM.
The first class will be this Friday in the Computer Club office.
It is a one credit hour class. If you take the CTF class 3 times, it counts as a CS Elective.
You can still sign up until this Friday, but you must send an email to nospace or sphinx as soon as possible.

Python Workshop

Some professors have asked the Computer Club to help with a python workshop for kids.
This could also help us teach about CTFs.
This would take place during March, so more details will come in the next couple of weeks.

Lifetime Membership

cokezero has been given lifetime membership for Computer Club because of his contributions to this club.
Thanks for all your help, cokezero!

Richard Stallman Talk

There is also a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xB1bnofsto.

Projector

We probably won&rsquo;t be able to use other Kohrman Hall rooms for talks.
Since we can&rsquo;t use another projector, we will have to consider options for getting our own projector for talks.

Router

We may need a new router, since we are currently encountering problems with our current office router.
Details about these issues will be discussed as we determine them.
Possible replacement routers will be considered when we get more information.

Backups

hellbacon is still looking to get a new server for backups. The price range may be between $600 and $700.
Some refurbished servers are also being considered, with one option being around $800.

The specs are 8 cores, 96 GB of RAM, and 10 TB of storage.
Here is a link if you would like more information: http://www.ebay.com/itm/181390661208.
Depending on heat output, we are planning on putting this server in Parkview.
If we cannot put it in Parkview, it will be put in the Computer Club office.


This server will also be used for projects, assignments, or virtual machines for Computer Club members.
Thanks to typo for contributing funds to help us get this new server!

Reminder about Downloading

All Computer Science students have been reminded in a recent email to not engage in any illegal file sharing on campus.
This is a reminder that students should not do illegal downloads on campus or in the Computer Club office.

WIDR

On Monday between noon and 2 PM, sloan will have an interview with tybalt from WIDR to talk about Computer Club as a part of the WIDR RSO Spotlight.
This will give us an opportunity to have free airtime on WIDR radio for advertising.

This may lead to other future opportunities to tell listeners about Computer Club.



Cumin Fundraiser

demorest has brought up the opportunity to have a fundraiser at the Cumin Indian Cuisine restaurant.
The plan is to have many people come in one night and obtain 15% of proceeds.
Here is how it would work:

Coordinate with the restaurant and sign up.
Publicize, get people to go there and spend money.
Computer Club would then get 15% of the money for that night.


The restaurant has a capacity of about 30 people.
Ask demorest on IRC if you want to get more information or if you want to show interest.

Computer Club Talks

nospace is having the first talk of the semester tonight about reversing a binary file after the meeting.
If you would like to sign up for a talk of your own, go to this link and fill out the form: https://goo.gl/forms/oGaElGo3fuDmfBUv1.
It is first-come, first-served, so make sure to sign up as soon as possible.
Reserving a topic and time is not required immediately, but it is important to reserve with your name as soon as possible if you want to give a talk.

IBM Workshop

We successfully have obtained enough interest to get support from IBM to have a workshop at Computer Club!
However, they originally wanted to hold the workshop next Monday.
They are currently working around their schedule, they may be able to set it up this November.
More details will come soon when we hear back from them through strongth.

sphinx

We want to take down signatures to send to the Computer Science department to give sphinx recognition.
This would be a recognition letter to show how much sphinx has helped us.
We will have a signatures sheet soon, ask any of the officers if you want to sign it.

PLAN

The PLAN schedule for tournaments should be on whatistheplan.com soon.
The next PLAN meeting will be next week at some time.

This time is not yet decided
Check IRC in the #plan channel to get more information.


In news about sponsors, Dr. Carr has helped us get donations through the Computer Science department.

This will make it easier for potential sponsors to give us funds.

Events

There is a Programming contest called ICPC on September 24, 12:00-5:00pm.

A team is ran by cpg, ask him for more information.
Check the #ICPC channel on IRC if you&rsquo;d like to learn more.


Auto-Owners IT Internship Opportunity.

A representative may come to club to offer internships.
This will happen on October 10th, RSVP for October 14th.


nospace is planning the First Showcase Saturday for the semester.

It is going to be an obstacle course of about 20 problems.
This should be a good way to learn Java or to get help in Java Computer Science classes.



CTF

One of the first big CTFs of the semester is going to be CSAW CTF this Friday (9/16) at 6:00 PM.
The CTF class ran by sphinx at 2 PM will give a good introduction to CTFs for anyone that wants to know more before CSAW starts.
CSAW CTF is a great CTF for beginners and can be a perfect opportunity to learn more about CTFs.
For people that don&rsquo;t know much about them, a CTF involves finding a digital flag inside a file or using exploits to find a hidden code.

This can be a great opportunity to learn more about software and security.


There will be pizza, so come by and work on some problems and enjoy some pizza!

PLAN

We discussed the potential days to hold PLAN meetings, and we have decided that PLAN meetings will be on Wednesdays at 6:30pm.
At the next PLAN meeting, they will be deciding the tournaments. If you want to give input on the organization and planning for PLAN, make sure to come by.

Oculus Rift

It was offered to buy a program for the Oculus Rift to play more games called Vorpx.
This program could give more access to more games to play.
However, after doing research, we have decided to not invest the $40.

Officer Positions

When cpg stepped down, we needed someone to replace him as VP of OPs.
It has been decided in the past couple weeks that kessler and sloan would take his place as organizers of PLAN.

With two people they may be able to share the weight.
We decided during the meeting to let sloan and kessler be Co-VPs of OPs.
sloan has been focusing on organizing and kessler has been scoping out potential businesses for sponsorship.


Additionally, twitch will be made the webmaster, as he has been working on the PLAN site lately.

Websites for RSOs

nospace went to an RSO meeting today and he learned valuable information about other RSOs.
Many RSOs need new websites and need help from us to get more updated websites.
We are considering ways that Computer Club can create websites in exchange for payments.

Part of the money will go to Computer Club and the rest will go to the person or people that created the website.


To learn more about this, join the #rsosites on IRC.

Video and Audio

We would like to have video and audio equipment for talks and other purposes.
We have received an offer from skuld and have considered asking sink for information about what equipment we should get.
Next week are planning to talk about possible budgets for the kinds of equipment we want to get.

Talks

nospace wants to start up bi-weekly talks, with nospace starting on September 29th.
We have offers from nospace, mobyte, skuld, demorest, and stringy to create talks.
We are also considering having practice talks for anyone that has not given a talk before.
nospace will create a sign-up form for people that want to give their own talks, so make sure to ask nospace if you&rsquo;d like to give a talk.
Before starting, it is suggested to get feedback from nospace to make sure the talk is presentable.

GIC Server

Since GIC is gone, we may be able to use their old server (jazz).
We will have to create a proposal or official document to give to Dr. Carr that will give us access to the server.
There will be more discussion about this in the next couple weeks. To learn more about how we will get the server and how we will use it, check the #officers channel on IRC.

Website Design Offer

Someone named Andrew came by to offer an opportunity to create a website using the Steam API for $800.
It is related to Team Fortress 2 and will use JavaScript and other things related to Web Design.
To learn more about this, email tf2tradingcompany@gmail.com.

IBM

strongth is still looking for sign-ups to show our interest in an IBM workshop.
If it becomes approved, IBM will send someone out and provide some materials for a 2-4 hour workshop.
We will need about 40 sign-ups and we currently have 20.
Let strongth know if you are interested and if you want to sign up.

Parkview Passport

Earlier today, many Computer Club members came to the Parkview to talk to incoming Freshmen about Computer Club.
flay showed up to help out at Parkview Passport by showing off his lockpicking demonstration.
hellbacon, tank, sphinx, nospace, stringy, kessler, kami, and flay all showed up to Parkview to help out. Thanks for all of your help!
We had about 47 people that gave emails to learn more about Computer Club and 2 people signed up for new accounts!
About 7 people signed up with our brand new Computer Club trial system.

This is a 14-Day trial account that lets potential members try out the Computer Club IRC server and gives them a chance to check out the other services offered on our server.
This is available to anyone that wants to learn more about Computer Club, not just Freshmen at Parkview Passport.
This means that we may continue to use this in the future if it ends up being a feature that people like.



PLAN

Thanks to everyone who came to the PLAN meeting last Sunday!

If you still want to help out, let sloan know on IRC.


They have developed a template for contacting sponsors. You can find this template in the topic of the #sponsors channel on IRC.

Some of the things on this template include a checklist of things sponsors should know if they want to help us for PLAN.


We are planning on revising the PLAN tournament schedule, but this is subject to change.
#sponsors is the channel to check out on IRC if you would like to learn more about volunteering for PLAN.

Upcoming Events

Next thursday meeting will be crowded, as it will be the first official meeting of the Fall 2016 semester.

Be sure to include incoming potential members.
Find out more about the new members, talk to them!


There will be minor cleaning in the Computer Club office this weekend, Sunday at 2 PM.

The plan is to clean the floors and tables.


The snake Showcase Saturday is being canceled, we are planning on moving onto something else (potentially a group project).

If you have any ideas for a Showcase Saturday project, let nospace know on IRC.


This 24th at noon, there will be a practice Programming Contest in C208 ran by cpg.

TEKSystems

sloan has got into contact with someone at TEKSystems named Dominic Zanoni.
He says they can provide some prizes for us.
In return, they may want a table to do some networking at PLAN.

PLAN Meeting

This Sunday, August 28 at 5 PM.
The plan is to create a template for contacting potential sponsors via email.
He would also like reach out to people wanting to be on a PLAN Committee that are willing to volunteer at any point during the PLAN preparation or event.
Another thing to do is to discuss which games will be tournaments during PLAN.
Finally, he wants to create a rough draft for a PLAN event schedule so we can let sponsors know what the event will be like.

IRC Changes

A current issue on IRC is that people can create users but we don&rsquo;t know who they are.
Our plans are to change this by requiring an LDAP login to use IRC.

This plan is still being discussed between officers and IRC operators and is subject to potential change.


stringy went over a quick demonstration how to join this new server by using weechat.
IRC bots will also need to send a password to log onto the IRC server if this change is put into effect.

At most, this may only need about two additional lines, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult for IRC bot developers.


There is not an ETA as to when this is going to be deployed, but if it will be put into effect, we will have to plan this at a certain time, so people will not be confused in figuring out how to rejoin IRC.

Events

This Saturday at 2 PM, bring your snake game to Computer Club for Showcase Saturday. See more details here: https://goo.gl/4MVIwq.
There is a CTF created by Facebook that is starting tonight at 10 PM. To see more information about this event, check the #ctf channel on IRC.
Parkview Passport is happening this September 1st from 1 PM to 4:30 PM. If you would like to help out, come to Computer Club around 10 AM or 11 AM.

Dropshock&rsquo;s Projects

Open Lockpicking Community is going to be started back up by Dropshock.

We could get half off lockpicks and lockpicking sets.
If you like lockpicking or you&rsquo;re interested in it, let him know you want to learn more!


Additionally, Dropshock is going to be creating a flight instrument panel to link to Microsoft Flight Simulator.

This project could be finished in a month.
Dropshock planning to make build logs for anyone that is interested.



Oculus Rift

nospace and kessler have found some games that we can use with the Razer Hydra.

We are planning to show these off at the Parkview Passport.
Big thanks to nospace and kessler for putting the time in to find some cool games and for setting up the Razer Hydra!


Sphinx wants to buy &lsquo;The Climb&rsquo; for $49.99

His suggestion is to buy it with Computer Club funds, but we did not come to a consensus as to whether or not we will buy it.



Website Project Offer

Henry Raybern, ceramic construction panel engineer came to our meeting.
He would like us to build a website for him.
See the #officers channel on IRC if you would like to get his contact information.

Progress

We have been cleaning up Computer Club over last weekend.
Thanks to nospace, stringy, mobyte, kami, hellbacon, and stoat for helping out!
Now we have a lot of things left over that we want to throw away in the corner near the room entrance. Take anything from the pile if you want, otherwise, it will be donated to be recycled or reused.

Computer Club Concessions

bigguy got new food and drinks for the Computer Club concessions.
We now have a good supply of Pop-Tarts, Mountain Dew, and other snacks.
Be sure to thank him for helping us out!

Sponsors

Sloan got a sponsor from TEKSystems.

They are offering to give us $500 for us to use during PLAN.
We are currently considering putting most or all of this towards prizes to give away for tournaments.
In return they would like a booth at PLAN or some advertising.
To find out more about them, check https://www.teksystems.com/.


We are still going to look for more sponsors, so let nospace or sloan know if you want to help. Additionally, you can offer volunteering help in the #sponsors channel on IRC.
Big thanks to sloan!

Weekend Goals

We are going to clean the Computer Club room this weekend.

The plan is to start cleaning this Sunday at 2PM.
We need all the help we can get. If you would like to help out, come by.
There will be pizza and music, so feel free to come help us.


Dr. Carr is inviting Auto Owner&rsquo;s Insurance recruiters looking for Systems Admins and Web Developers.

Security related jobs could possibly be involved.
Check next week&rsquo;s minutes if you are interested.


HTTPS certificate is up and running for the website.

This means it&rsquo;s time to start planning for PLAN.
Since our website is ready, our priority is getting sponsors and making sure everything is going to be ready.
To start it off, we are going to start planning to find sponsors this Saturday at 12 Noon.


At 2 PM on Saturday we are having the Showcase Saturday event.

The challenge is to make a snake game.
Anything is allowed here regardless of quality. Come check it out and show off what you&rsquo;ve been working on!
To get more details about this or to see the rules, go here: https://goo.gl/4MVIwq.


We are going to get a food list ready for bigguy to restock the Computer Club food supply.

If you want to discuss this food list or want specific things, go to #shoppinglist on IRC or tell us in the #officers channel.



Upcoming Events

Passport day is going to be on September 1st.

This is an event we have at Parkview every year to show incoming Freshmen what Computer Club is all about.
Some of our current ideas are to take the 3D printer and Oculus Rift.
stringy had the idea to have a monitor demo facing the hallway so people passing by can see it.
If you have any of your own ideas for things to show off to Freshmen, let us know on IRC.
The time of this event is soon to come. If you would like to volunteer or help out, let any one of the officers know.



Shirts

Our plan is to use our current Computer Club shirt design as our shirt for events, such as CTFs and Parkview Passport.
If you are interested in seeing this design or buying one for yourself, see this link: http://www.redbubble.com/people/chrissphinx/collections/515635-computer-club-crow.
Ideally, we would like to have these shirts ready to use at the Parkview Passport event.

Defcon 2016

tmiley, sphinx, nospace, and stringy are back from Defcon.
Here are some tips they gave to anyone that wants to go to Defcon:

They highly recommended checking out the events and workshops.
A point tmiley made was to check the website in advance and see what things you want to check out.
Pre-registering for the workshops online is essential.
Recommended to not prioritize seeing talks, as you have many chances to see them at a later time.
If staying in the same hotel as the Defcon event, they could stream talks to their room.


They also have brought pictures and videos, which will be shared online soon.

If you want to see those, check the minutes or keep checking on IRC.


Overall, they all had a great time. There was talk about taking a group again next year, so keep it in mind for next year if you want to go!

Oculus Computer

We received the final parts for the Oculus Rift computer.
We will start building it today.
If you want to come check out the completed build and give the Oculus Rift a try, try it out at Computer Club!

PLAN Sponsorship

We need to make sure the sponsorship for League of Legends from Riot is secured.
Additionally, we should see if we can get sponsorship from Valve for Dota 2 and CS:GO.
We should ask WIDR for airtime and/or some sponsorship.
Capcom could also help sponsorship for a Street Fight V tournament.
Some other ideas:

Monster
Red Bull
Bawls


If you want to help with getting sponsorships, let us know. We will be choosing people for the PLAN committee soon.

Parkview Passport

We want to be doing the Parkview Passport event again on September 1st.
This is our chance to recruit some Freshmen and to get our name out there.
Some ideas of things we want to bring to show off are lockpicking sets, the Oculus Rift, and the 3D Printer.
We will need volunteers to help talk to Freshmen about Computer Club.

If you want to help, come to the meetings following up to September 1st to see ways you can get involved.



Showcase Saturday

Showcase Saturday is not happening this Saturday since nospace is at Defcon, but it will be resuming the following week.
The challenge is to program a game in the style of the Snake game.
More details will follow in the meeting minutes for next week.

Since we don&rsquo;t have all of the parts yet, we are delaying the PC build to a later date.
Details on when this will be should be on IRC as soon the parts arrive.
The total cost of the PC ended up being $1175.15.

PLAN

We need sponsors as soon as possible.

The pictures from previous PLANs will be a big part in this.
Please let us know if you have any extra pictures from PLAN that you can share.


Anyone who is willing to volunteer with organizing PLAN should talk to nospace.
Additionally, next Wednesday we are having a PLAN meeting at 6PM.

Come by if you are interested in helping us out.

PLAN Preparation

cpg is not going to be the VP of OPs so we will need a group of people to work on plan.
Hardison will help us make a list of things to do that we will need to organize plan.
The group of people that are going to help with plan will need to be able to make important decisions.
People will need to be able to be committed if they want to help.
We will need to organize plan far in advance so we will not need to worry about setting things up shortly before PLAN.
Since Hardison won&rsquo;t be here during PLAN, we will definitely need people to help out.
sponsors should be a priority.

We should have one person dedicated to sponsors.
We should build our relationship with potential sponsors so we can get in contact with them quicker in the future.
We will definitely need help from giggles to get the League of Legends Riot sponsorship.


501(c)(3) is a requirement for many businesses, but instead we may be able to obtain funds by putting them through the University.
Someone will need to rent out the rooms early at Parkview.
bigguy, our VP of finance, will be the person to help us get concessions.

We should focus on getting a wide variety and enough of popular items, since leftover items will go to Computer Club.


Additionally, the webmaster will need to set up the website in advance so people can sign up.
Pre-registration on the website should go up about a month in advance.

Pre-registration gives us general attendance information, tournament interest information, MAC addresses, and tournament team registration.


Posters should also go up early so people know about PLAN.
An Overwatch tournament is expected to bring in a lot more people.
If we need any more information or if we have any questions, we can contact Hardison.
Over the next couple weeks, we will be dividing the needed tasks for PLAN to multiple people.

Oculus Rift Computer

Our temporary machine for playing on the Oculus Rift is gone.
We should buy a new gaming PC if we want to power the Oculus Rift.
mobyte has put a PCPartPicker link in IRC (http://pcpartpicker.com/list/yL8vVY), check it out and give feedback if you want to help us pick out the new computer for Computer Club.

Lockpicking Demo

Jason Johnson is giving a lockpicking demo this Monday at 2PM.
stringy will be there helping to teach high-schoolers about lockpicking.
If anyone wants to help, let stringy know.

Minecraft Server

We&rsquo;re playing Minecraft on a server right now.
If you want to join us, join the #minecraft channel on IRC and join the IP in the topic.

Events

nospace is thinking of shutting down the Showcase Saturday and Coding Challenge Sunday events.
It might be put on hold until the semester starts but nospace is trying to gauge interest.

Monitors

We got 8 new monitors from pasportit&rsquo;s office.
What do we want to do with them?

We need to work on wiring to the arcade cabinet and installing games.

We need help from anyone that can give us advice on wiring for the old arcade cabinet system.
We are struggling to figure it out.
Please let tank or nospace know if you are good with wiring or have experience with the arcade cabinet.


It will run SNES, NES, and GameBoy games.

MAME

Parts list for the MAME is in the # channel.
Buttercup approves and has ordered the parts for $18.49. The parts should be here quickly since they are directly from Amazon.
Here is the link to the parts list if you would like to look at it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19g1Ns4GCh3SpL-ScpXKZeOpNhCtxahVLpqQRYSGw-Xg/edit?usp=sharing
One part is listed as extra since it is optional, we will wait until after we finish the main build to see if it is necessary.

Orientation

We don&rsquo;t have anything to hand out at Orientation.
Can we think of something to give out for free for this and at Parkview Passport?
Ideas brought up at the meeting: Breadboards, pens, RAM keychain, flash drives, bottle openers, pins.
nospace is going to research to see the pricing on each of these objects.

Society of Plastics Engineers

grizzzly has asked if anyone would be interested in doing a website for Society of Plastics Engineers, ask him for details.

Room Cleaning

nospace is going to be cleaning the Computer Club room at 2PM.
Come by if you would like to help.

We could have the idea of designing an API for an IRC bot.
cpg and demorest have brought up this idea, we may think of doing this next weekend.

19 people in attendance, including: stringy, sphinx, cpg, mobyte, buttercup, Dropshock, nospace, hellbacon

6:34 PM, On a Thursday, 2225 Kohrman Hall
Oculus Rift

We are now considering to get the Nvidia 1070 instead of the 970, so we will wait until that comes out.
The price range should be somewhere between $800 and $1000.
Ohaimark&rsquo;s offer still stands to sell us his computer.
We should consider parts with good warranties, since our machines at Computer Club get a lot of usage.
The machine will need at least 3 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port.

Projects

Nospace has an idea to look at online courses of interest to club.
Nospace would like to get a Computer Club Coursera or UDEMY account.

If you are interested in this, let nospace know.
We can pick out 2 or 3 courses, and then vote on which one to take for a week.


Hellbacon is redesigning the POS to be web based. It is using jQuery and PHP for maintainability.

Some people have suggested using a framework instead of PHP.
LDAP support has also been suggested.
It will possibly also have Paypal support by using their API.
We should also look at AndroidPay support.


We are going to try to do at least one or two hackathons this summer.
Demorest wants to implement ranked voting to stringy&rsquo;s existing voting program.
Ohaimark and tank are in progress of working on the MAME cabinet. They should start work next week. They may need many hardware parts to replace and they will likely make a list for us.
Nospace has brought up his noise detector idea for putting a Raspberry Pi on the wall that can give alerts when the noise in the room is too loud. ADAFruit sells a sound level kit (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microphone-amplifier-breakout/measuring-sound-levels).
Cpg is working on a Google Calendar bot in Go.
We may be starting a new general bot with an emphasis on helping people learn how to create their own bots. Python is the main idea for what we want to use.

We will have a discussion about this in July.



Angular

Angular hackathon is starting tomorrow at 8PM.

5 people in attendance: nospace, stringy, cpg, ohhimark, and mobyte

On a Thursday, 6:00PM, 2225 Kohrman Hall
Defcon

If you&rsquo;re interested in Defcon 2016, get in contact with flay on IRC.
Estimated cost would be $1000.

Oculus Rift

Our consumer edition Oculus Rift has arrived!
However, none of our computers at the Computer Club can handle its awesomeness.
We&rsquo;re thinking of building a new computer with capable hardware so we can run it.
Based on a cost estimate by mobyte, it may cost somewhere between $700 and $1000.

I will post a parts list on IRC and people can give feedback.


Alternatively, ohhimark is offering to sell us a computer.

Specs are: Intel i5-4690k overlocked at atbout 4.5GHz, Z79 ASRock Motherboard, lots of fans, 8GB DDR3-2133 RAM, 120GB SSD, 850W 80&#43;Bronze PSU, and GTX 780 GPU.
We would probably need to swap out the GPU.


We can compare our final parts list to what ohhimark is offering and see which machine we go with.

Kohrman Swipe Access

We now have swipe access for the Kohrman building.
However, only two people are given access: stringy and nospace.
nospace will be in the computer club office a lot in the summer, so check with him on IRC if you want to get in the room.
In the fall, kami and nospace will be the holders of swipe access.

Summer Project Ideas

Shall we start up hackathons again? Anyone have any ideas for new projects?
hellbacon wants to make a web version of the POS, contact him if you want to help.
ohhaimark is working on an ergonomic mechanical keyboard (Dactyl). Check the wiki for info (https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu/wiki/Dactyl_Keyboard).
nospace has brought up the idea fix the arcade cabinet, ohhimark knows electrical work, so he could help.
Angular is an ongoing project, we could use ideas for what we&rsquo;d like to do

nospace suggested noise detector for room


Do we want to work on another general purpose bot, similar to botler?
If you weren&rsquo;t at the meeting and you have ideas of your own, let us know on IRC.

Spring PLAN Feedback

Lack of sponsors is a con, we need to prepare for sponsorships far in advance.
We should coordinate more events for people to encourage them to stay for longer. A possibility is to prepare a losers bracket tournament in advance.
The format for the LoL tournament is narrowed down well. Should we start the tournament later?
Have some form of communication for people to talk to each other. Discord or IRC are possibilities.
We should get the PLAN website to auto-pull from the github repo.
A dedicated IT person (or two) to help with technical issues, specifically on the network, would be useful.
We should buy gigabit switches to deal with dead port issues and/or get the broken ports to be fixed.

sphinx, cpg, transistor, and hardison volunteer to test all of the ports in D109 in the summer.


The one day format is preferable to the two format. Sunday as clean-up day makes it much easier. Going later into Saturday night is a possibility if people want it.
Better organization for the Smash tournament has been requested by sans.
LoL RSO ran the tournament very well. We should get help from them again, as it helped with the workload. However, the PLAN director should still check in on them.
sans is interested in helping run the Smash tournament.
Dell and Strength in Numbers should come again. We should request better prizes from Dell. We could use a list of expectations from Strength in Numbers.
kami wants to do concessions.
If people don&rsquo;t bring their own ethernet cables, we should sell cables to them.

Use an ethernet tester to make sure they work.



Goals for Next PLAN

Shoot for $2000 in profits.

Getting sponsors and advertising is very important.


Look at what people concessions bought in the Spring 2016 PLAN and focus on those for the Fall 2016 PLAN.
We should focus on advertising on specific subreddits in order to market specific tournaments.
Putting out posters at the right time is key.

Put them up one month before PLAN?


Multiple posters is a possibility. One poster design for each tournament?
We should try to get advertisement at the library.

Date for Next PLAN

The plan is to work around midterms, other events, sports events.
The current possibilities are September 17, October 15, November 5/12/26, and December 3/10/17.
Top candidate is November 5th, with November 12th as a runner up.

PLAN Committee

cpg will appoint a group of people as a PLAN Committee.
PLAN meetings in the future will be smaller and more focused.
The Tournament Coordinator will oversee all tournaments and make sure tournaments are running smoothly and tournaments are starting on time.
The Support Technician will handle networking problems before, during, and after PLAN, as well as being a contact for OIT.
The Assistant PLAN Director will help the VP of OPs with any other additional tasks.
An additional Volunteer Coordinator will help in concessions and event check-in.
The main people running PLAN and running tournaments should not be able to win prizes or play in tournaments.

Notes taken by mobyte
About 10 people present

Stats

About 150 people came on Saturday
Total (raw) profits were approximately $1750.25
97% of these profits were made on Saturday

Snack discussion

Idea was variety, certain things didn&rsquo;t sell as well

Work on optimizing most profitable things


NO GIANT BAG OF POPCORN
Pizza and pop sold well

On Sunday, get a lot less pizza


Mountain dew, coke most popular drinks

Stick to regular monster, don&rsquo;t need special kinds


Skip pop tarts or buy less
Chips/pretzels all in same category, make this more distinct for next PLAN?
Only 3 cookies sold
29 items of candy sold
Get more oatmeal cream pies, really popular
Need better menu and keeping track of items sold

POS System potential? Solves a lot of issues such as inventory tracking


Bottom line, candy and soda are best

Scheduling

Saturday is just more popular, Sunday is still dead
Start on Saturday around noon, make event continuous overnight as long as possible?

Sunday for only cleanup
Move Magic to Friday night?
Longer Saturday and ignore Sunday
97% of profits made on Saturday


Project M not as popular, stick to Melee?
Magic and Hearthstone at separate times, not at the same time.

Put on Saturday



Drugs

Issues with Adderall

No, really


Update to add rule against non-perscribed drugs

Tournaments

Optimize the CS:GO tournament more, finals went on went too long
Riot should only prize to first 5 places

Determining tiebreakers is essential so we can avoid confusion


Structuring tournaments needs to be more decisive
Spectating or streaming by players is not allowed without talking to the tournament director first
Get summoner names from League people, these are important

Prizes

We need prizes sooner in advance so we can advertise them better
Prizes are important as an advertising utility, we should prepare for more people coming to PLAN next semester

Planning next PLAN

Soon we should start planning for Spring PLAN

Plan around the Spring schedule so we do it after midterms
Mid-late march or early April

Possibly late March




Replace TF2 with something else

Start thinking about a different game

Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm?




Keep Rocket League tournament, turned out to be popular
Dota 2 also went well

First Meeting of the 2015-2016 Academic Year!

A welcome to our new members and a welcome back to our old ones!

Door

We do not currently have a door bot, so the most reliable way to tell whether the room is occupied is with the $office command. If your computer&rsquo;s MAC address is registered with fish (one of our bots) and you are in the room, members on IRC will see your nickname following the $office command.
Type $office -r [Your MAC Address] into #geekboy and fish will register your computer.

Office Hours

Officers of Computer Club are required to hold office hours in order to keep the room open for members that need help, or just want a place to hang out.
Office hours can be found on our office hours calendar or our events page. Run $office in #geekboy if you would like to know what officers are in the room at any time.

Communities and Schools

Last year, we sent some volunteers to the Main Street Magnet School for a robotics workshop for students.
Contact sphinx, or send an email to emilydemorest@gmail.com if you are interested in volunteering this year.

Alumni Testimonials

At Dr. Trenary&rsquo;s request, we are collecting testimonials about Computer Club from our members, alumni and student alike. Since this club has been such a large part of our lives, their experiences and memories will be very valuable. This will go into the newsletter and onto the website in order to give the outside community a more clear idea of what we are about.
Please send any stories and testimonials to ccpresident@yakko.cs.wmich.edu.

MIOSHA Compliance

Our room is currently in the process of becoming MIOSHA compliant.
flay, stringy, and Dr. Trenary have met with two members of the OSHA committee and the building manager of Kohrman Hall. The overall tone of the meeting was very positive.

Newsletter

flay is currently working on the content of our first newsletter to be sent to the university community.
It is scheduled to be sent out at the beginning of the Fall 2015 semester.

Video Camera

We would like to purchase a camera to ensure the production quality of our future videos.
Our allocation for the camera with other audio and video equipment is $500.

Middle School Robotics

The middle school robotics program will be starting up again this fall. You may contact Emily Demorest (emilydemorest@gmail.com) for information.

Saleae Logic Analyzer

We will be getting a significant educational discount for a Saleae Logic Analyzer to complement our oscilloscope.
This discount also applies to other university students. If you would like to buy one for yourself, Computer Club can put yours on the same order. Contact flay (ccpresident@yakko.cs.wmich.edu) by Monday, August 3rd if you interested.

Kalamazoo Public Library

The Kalamazoo Public Library is a possible venue for Computer Club to hold demonstrations for local children.
Any ideas for an interactive event geared toward middle school and/or elementary students are welcome.

Personal Projects

Contact flay (ccpresident@yakko.cs.wmich.edu) with any personal projects relevant to Computer Club that you would like featured in the newsletter.

Jobs

Job listings are found on our wiki.
OIT, the CAE center, and a company called SpareFoot are hiring, plus more! Check the page out.

Hackathons, CTFs, and Workshops

These will be grouped under an event called a Geekout, which could be a CTF, a hackathon, or a workshop.
Look at the wiki page for our ideas.

BountyBucks

Demorest is still making progress!

Tutoring Hours

We would like to start holding tutoring hours lead by members that can tutor in computer-related subjects.
C208 has been used as a tutoring center, but it will not be available from the CS department anymore. This is a perfect opportunity for us to take that over.
If you will have available time for this next semester, please talk to cpg, Hardison, or flay.

Alumni Dinner

An alumni dinner is a possibility in the future.
If you are interested in planning this, or Geekouts, or PLAN, talk to Hardison.

Parkview Passport

Think of new and better ways to bring up new members so they are always very involved
We&rsquo;re putting out a newsletter to get some publicity for the club.
Demorest: WMU is offering vpn access to have place to play around and hack, maybe getting a subnet set up to play with and break stuff. This would be super cool for the club! We need someone to take the lead on setting it up.

###PLAN:

no riot sponsorship, the RSO forgot to contact riot and we don&rsquo;t have the necessary time or teams signed up for sponsorship to allow a riot sponsorship
not a lot of teams have signed up yet, may be for the better
not a lot of advertisement
This plan will more than likely be smaller, we will need to provide prizes
The idea to push PLAN back was tossed around, but is not really viable

By Renix!
improvements by flay

Meeting begin 6:12pm

###Head Count:

38

###Trenary:

Wants to see us all institutionalize ourselves better
Get better at making a regular processes for the club (Agenda, feeding &amp; caring of younger members, inclusivity)
Have younger members or any memebers jump in and help with projects and events more
Steve Carr is willing to talk about the possibility of officers getting 1 credit hour for being a part in the club per semester.
Think of new and better ways to bring up new members so they are always very involved
We&rsquo;re putting out a newsletter to get some publicity for the club.
Demorest: WMU is offering vpn access to have place to play around and hack, maybe getting a subnet set up to play with and break stuff. This would be super cool for the club! We need someone to take the lead on setting it up.
Start building up a database for club contacts old and new
IRC is for everybody. Argue/Debate constructively.

We&rsquo;re not going to talk about how we&rsquo;re going to store email addresses.
We&rsquo;re going to write the script for now and deal with where to store them later.

PLAN:
Butters sent an email to cotton about a subnet for PLAN

Mame Cabinet:
We&rsquo;ve got it sanded!
Working on it after the meeting.
Staining black?  Might require some careful sanding.
Painting black?  not as pretty.
The cabinet is covered in wood filler so staining would be a bad idea.

MAME: Heat gun is working well stripping paint, but we need to work more often on mame. Drc has made some progress on led buttons for the mame, horray colors! Talk about cool future projects to build into the led, like progress lights, etc.

PLAN tourneys: L4D2, CS:S.
*Talk about a pool of 1v1 games and each person in the bracket would play a different random game. Smaller prize, based on what we get from sponsors. Also will be contingent on MAME status.
*Talk about doing a console game [tournament]. Decided no.
*Check the wave for sponsership status.

We need to start keeping tabs at a more reasonable level.

Idea to create cronjob/something to remind members that their account is expiring soon. Also, we need to collect alternative emails from members. This will be used since many people do not check yakko mail.

We started the MAME sanding, now will be using the heat gun to finish. Need to acquire a small putty knife, then sand after.&lt;br &gt;

9/25/2010 PLAN:&lt;br &gt;

Counterstrike&lt;br &gt;
HALO (Console)&lt;br &gt;
&lt;br &gt;

&lt;br &gt;
HoN requires tons of advertising, the game needs to be bought. If we can&rsquo;t get sponsorship, do we still want to do this?&lt;br &gt;

*Moniter has been removed! (Still not safe to touch because it rechares over night)&lt;br &gt;
*We have the led buttons, the work!&lt;br &gt;
*to do: sand cabinet and prime. Already bought the stuff!&lt;br &gt;
*discussion to purchase a heat gun, cheap, and will be helpful in stripping the vinyl off of the pannel.&lt;br &gt;
*alternative: finding somewhere on campus to bend and mill a new pannel.&lt;br &gt;
&lt;br &gt;
PLAN E:&lt;br &gt;
This weekend!&lt;br &gt;
Friday, come by and set up.&lt;br &gt;
Sat, 11am - midnight!&lt;br &gt;
&lt;br &gt;
Air conditioner broke :/&lt;br &gt;
-fuse?&lt;br &gt;
If we call maintence to fix it, we need to clean everthing. EVERYTHING.&lt;br &gt;
&lt;br &gt;
CS Cop&lt;br &gt;
He&rsquo;s starting up a hardware review site, wanted to see who&rsquo;s intereseted, maybe to trade links back and forth, but mostly to do reviews for his site. He mentioned things like watercooling systems that are being given away on his forum. Things are being given away, for real, and he wants to branch out into software/tv applications as well. Site:www.BURNEDiN.com via Matt Page.&lt;br &gt;

&lt;br &gt;
We need to do fundraising!&lt;br &gt;
One item listed on craigslist so far.&lt;br &gt;
Discussion to sell the xraid.&lt;br &gt;
Everyone likes it better than a cclub fileserver. Also, we could use that money to buy a tv and storage! We should probably give PhorceP a cut, that would be fair. &lt;br &gt;
Basically, we have a ton of small stuff to sell on ebay, then build up our raiting. Then, sell the xraid for bank. &lt;br &gt;
Vote to sell with all components: Passed.&lt;br &gt;
&lt;br &gt;
Minutes need to be revamped. We need to edit out profanity and un-necessary slang. These are public, and need to be useful. We need to go back and edit the minutes (old minutes) to preserve our reputation. Drc is to become a supscript of each meeting. &lt;br &gt;
&lt;br &gt;
Vote to approve review of minutes from prior meeting for clarity/consistency. Passed.&lt;br &gt;

Members present: rancor, zerg, ohnomrbill, butters, grg, cokezero, drc

drc Taking minutes

ohnomrbill has brought in a form for application for an armature radio club license.  We&rsquo;re not sure if we trust ourselves to not break FCC rules (i.e. we are immature rather than armature).  FCC rules don&rsquo;t allow for anything fun (no encryption, etc, what&rsquo;s the point?)

MAME cabinet discussion -  Do we have enough drive space?  Probably, but butters would like more.  We are going to document everything we do to make the system work, and turn it into a script to modify a stock/standard Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) LTS install.  After we get the system built, Zerg would like to get a cap kit for the monitor and repaint the cabinet.  Rancor would like to wait until after Bronco Bash to work on aesthetic changes of the machine.

PLAN - We should probably think about getting in touch with Cotton about VLAN scripts.  What will be brought to Parkview, do we need a truck?  Possibly we&rsquo;ll bring a fridge and some candy.  Not anticipating a large turn out for the Summer PLAN as they generally are not, and we have not been aggressively advertising.

DRC ambles in soon after.

Kyle has shaving problems but also has a fundraiser idea or something
He thinks the club should recycle used/old electronics, jewelry, etc. Ecophone has a program where you print out shipping labels, send stuff in and receive a check.
Includes receipts for tax exemption. We can also order promotional materials from their website. (A recycling pyramid scheme) If people drop off valuable equip. the club can keep it/resell it.
They take ink jet cartridges, cellphones, laptops, cellphone batteries, jewelry?, etc.
The school would possibly give the club money to operate this project (Green Initiative?).
Sounds badass. That&rsquo;d be sweet says Butters.

Let&rsquo;s buy a tv. Okay. Now we need money. Okay.

Summer PLAN: June 19
Advertising on website and a few forums, nothing big. Profit: Sell last PLAN t-shirts, charge for non-members (decision TBA)

Hackinac Island! DRC proposes spending a four day weekend hacking as much of Mackinac Island as possible. Nice.
Seems to be lots of interest among club members. Alternatively, a group could go to HOPE.
Hackinaw and Hackinac domain names available!

Butters passively aggresively tells everyone to stay on topic.

Friendship Village this weekend: Cokezero and Smerky?

Jessie&rsquo;s info on renting a mobile arcade for Bronco Bash. $200/day for rental from KlassicArcade in Gobels, Michigan. Need to check with Bronco Bash organizers to make sure we&rsquo;ll have enough power/Space.
Possibly co-rent the arcade with Red Button. WSA could possibly give us money, especially if two RSO&rsquo;s are involved.

They also have two empty cabinets they would be willing to give us for free. Black one in rough shape but with better specs/Gray one is better shape without all the bling.
Jessie emailed Klassic Arcade and requested the black cabinet and getting a tube. Tubes approx. $80.

Pinballatthezoo.com: April 16th and 17th, $10, play pinball all day

Begin contacting possible sponsors: Greg (Balls!) Kyle (Danger Den)

Nominations for new officers: Rancor and Butters for President and also Vice President. Dylan for VP. Cokezero for Treasurer. Scrabble for Secretary. Kneuts for President (declined).
Think about nominations being done by secret ballot this year. DRC can set up a phonotron voting system. Voting will be April 15th.

Long term goal: Update Constitution

Keys and crap still seem to be a problem ^_^ and its really hot in HERE.

Meeting started: 6:03pm
DRC was already here when the meeting started. So surprising.
Talk about friendship village. 2nd or 3rd week of April, Cokezero and Butters.
Kyle requested censorship of the minutes to protect the identities of certain members activities on St. Patricks Day.
6:04 � Butters calls Whitehat with Google Voice. Mentions that Fonotron is racist and doesn�t like dealing with Japanese numbers.
6:05 � Talk of PLAN profits.  No bill for CClub PLAN shirts yet, talking with Studio to keep updated on information on billing and whatnot.  Cost is ~$260.  Looks like we �basically� broke even on PLAN costs/profit. 
6:07 � Smerky hands out leaking Bawls. Zerg shotguns one of them. Lots of slurping sounds and possibly a stain or two on the floor. Smerky finds the experience �unpleasant�
6:08 � 6:20 � Back to PLAN talk. Thoughts about an �After Action� review on ways to improve for PLAN 14. Earlier advertising.  Butters takes responsibility for failed advertising.  Could use better documentation of efforts planned or completed in case transfer of main PLAN planning duties needs to switch (i.e. Lyth ragequiting) Kyle volunteers to make Nerd-Scout Cookies for next PLAN.
PLAN 14 planned date � September 25th.
Info on BroncoBash will be posted in May, might require shift in PLAN date.
Minimum of two months for initial contact with possible Sponsors.
Keep working list of PLAN sponsors.
July 30th for shirt designs due. 
Smerky complains about frozen Bawls.
Possibly get sponsors to chip in on shirt costs, put their logo on the back.
6:20 � Geekouts? Ideas? Next weekend, not this weekend (2 weeks after PLAN) Start advertising, email Kaminski.  Times? 11am - ?? on Saturday. Activity will be Hack This Site, in CClub Offce
6:22 � UberYakko.  Yakko has uptime of 4 days, 6 days before that, 10 days before that�.. really need UberYakko up.  Getting things up (Butters, DRC, etc..) working on PHP/MySQL/syncing home dirs, waiting on drc�s contributions to finish up initial requirements.  Finish by end of month? (HA!).  Betting started on when Yakko will crash. General consensus of within 1 week.

Meeting starts at 6:17PM.

SENIOR DESIGN IDEA:
Dr.Trenary has a plot to rule the world. Actual idea is for seniors with to integrate their projects with the computer club so that people can do things that they are interested in. Projects would turn in to large scale possibly and possibly long term. This could bring good &ldquo;bang&rdquo; for the computer club. Computer club would act as a client of the seniors who are doing the projects.

We should come up with a really good project so that the CS project will allow it for a senior design project.

Possible software project to interact with class schedules. Other idea is some sort of streaming application.

Distribuated rendering idea for the project. It would be for rendering anything from home. Rendering idea could ideally lead to a tesula cluster.

The new computer is in and it smells real nice.

COMPUTER NAME BRAINSTORMING:
Thunder Pussy
Mavis Beacon
Microsoft Clippy
Olmac
Box
TrapBox
Hal 9000
PornServer
GodPigeon
OverMind
BlackBox
The Internet
loldongs


BUYING MICE:
Vote passed to buy 5 mice from TigerDirect with $20 rebates. Mice cost $20 each. Alex Bell will reimburse the club if we get jipped out.

Go visit Zergs gallery at Friday, 5-8pm reception in south Korham on the bottom floor.

ELECTIONS:
President: Greg
Treasurer &amp; VP: Travis Thompsom and Lyth Alobiedat
Co-VP of OPs: 8 Votes for Jonathon Klobucar, 9 votes for Steffen Hunt
VP of Fin: Alex Bell
Secretary: Chris Phillips

LDAP:
LDAP NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. Or else we&rsquo;re without email by the end of the semester.
We need to get the email stuff straightened out by the end of the semester. We need to set up an LDAP query by the end of the semester. Groups need to be included also.
Could keep it on Uber or another machine but it needs to get down.

POSSIBLE PURCHASES:
Talking about possibly buying a computer. But it is being held off in case the Bradford system goes into implementation. We also have about $1400. Kyle said that he put together a good machine on newegg for $700. We may hold off on buying it if we need to by gigabyte switches.
If Bradford system is implemented then we may have to do all the wiring for PLAN our selves. The cost figures for cabling would be $70 1000 foot spool of Cat5e and $40 for 200 male connectors.

Drc arrives at 6:38PM.

Sudo: Some users with sudo were using it to play pranks on other users and so lost their sudo privilege.  As of now there are no sudo guidelines so we will be brainstorming and putting new rules into the constitution.

Potential Sudo Guidelines: 
No unauthorized access without just cause
No pranks what-so-ever, respect other members
All software additions/removals must be made public (possibly creating a separate log file for installs)
No installing potentially harmful software
Sudo access will be granted by President and Vice President
If these guidelines are not followed Sudo will be suspended until the situation is reviewed by President and VP

Balloon project is still active, FYI.

Purchase of a bulb for the projector has been authorized!

Zerg&rsquo;s presentation tomorrow 8:00pm in Dunbar, Studio A (in the basement). It&rsquo;s about motion capture! It&rsquo;s gonna be awesome! Whitehat is gonna wear a skin tight suit! 2009-02-04">

Friendship Village
Saturday January, 14th

Apparently Scarlet isn&rsquo;t actually a freshman anymore due to some sort of &ldquo;credits&rdquo;. You may still call him freshman but he would appreciate air quotes when using the term. This is entirely optional, however.

Presentations:
January 22nd- VIM presented by Steffo
January 29th- Phishing presented by Whitehat
February 5th- Motion Capture presented by Zerf
February 12th- Intellectual Property Law presented by DRC
February 19th- TCP/IP presented by Lazer
February 26th- Something by Cowbar
March 19th- Soft RAID presented by Cameron

PLAN- Tentatively March, 28
Team Fortress II
Guitar Hero
Smash Bros. Brawl
Left 4 Dead
Everyone loves the idea of a &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; PLAN (Retro-PLAN, Ye Olde PLAN)

Wass is okay.

Cleaning party this Saturday. There will be PIZZA. It will be around  If you don&rsquo;t come, you don&rsquo;t get to keep your club key. We&rsquo;re still looking into alternatives to this key problem. Getting a doorknob with key pad is a possible option. Building services are probably the people to talk to.

C-Club getting in on an open source project, or starting up one of our own. Such as, a blackboard application.

DRC arrives 6:47

Need LDAP 

Lazer likes Pixar movies.

Welcome back!

The building coordinator will not give us any more keys. Jesse suggests we get a key safe to put on the door so every club member has access. Club is unofficially allocating $20 to this project.
Cameron is looking into getting a list of names who keys have been signed out to so we can track them down (there are over 12 out there!)

Greg&rsquo;s Analogy: Would you go to a friends house and, not understanding how a microwave works, stick a bunch of metal in it and run it for a couple hours? Well, don&rsquo;t do that thing to our server!
Translation: Don&rsquo;t fork bomb the server on accident.

Office Cleaning
This must be done or we may lose our room! We should schedule a monthly cleaning date.

Presentations Finalized! Jen refuses to make another list of possible presentation topics because she is forced to do this every week. Please see previous minutes.
Smidget-Jan. 7th

Greg makes a chart: Who is not available on what days
Mon-0
Tue-10
Wed-4
Thur-10
Fri- No one wants to come
Splitting up meetings and presentations? 
bad idea- presentations would get no turn out, they&rsquo;d be forgotten about
good idea- drink specials at Bilbo&rsquo;s

Presentations are tentatively going to be scheduled on Thursdays at 8:00pm.  This avoids conflicts with professors we want to come who have classes, etc. 
Next presentation is Steffo&rsquo;s VIM presentation on Jan. 22nd.
February 5th is Photoshop or motion capture presented by Zerg

PLAN
We made $388! More than usual, despite having a lower turn out. People who won tournaments will be able to come for free next PLAN.
IDEA: Have a new (easier) tournament next time to encourage less hard-core gamers to enter or have a designated noob tournament
We definitely need more sponsors next time since we had no prizes! 

Access points need to get up this week.

Uber-Yakko was supposed to be up by Thanksgiving! What&rsquo;s the deal? It&rsquo;s not yet mounted properly

If anyone knows where &ldquo;this&rdquo; power supply goes, let Cameron know.

Friendship Village is this weekend. Meeting at C-club at 12:00 and driving over by 1:00. Dora, Greg and Smerky are going, anyone else is welcome to join.

DRC arrives 6:21

CLEAN UP THE CLUB OFFICE YOU SLACKERS
ALSO, take anything you may be working on that you don&rsquo;t want messed with, moved, or accidently thrown out. The office will be cleaned over break.

Tabs need to be paid before break. The limit for tabs is $5. Don&rsquo;t go over! Cameron will come get you.

DRC brought in an example of his TV-begone project kit if anyone wants to check it out. Tis super cool. Projects are costing $15 now, but the club is subsidizing the kits down $10. The proceeds will go to creating more project kits. DRC made TV-begone and a programmer kits, he is super awesome. Kyle loves him, but don&rsquo;t we all.

Whitehat is gonna pick up some more wire strippers for the club. 

Conference Idea
Host a weekend conference sometime on a couple specific topics. We could re-present previous presentations, host a couple workshops, get Trenary to come talk and maybe host a guest speaker. Sometime in March or April possibly. Conference ideas: COMPUTERS

Presentation Ideas Next Semester
Smidget will be presenting early January (on something)
Cameron: RAID presentation
DRC: Software laws (and conspiracy theories, I suspect)
Whitehat: Social engineering
Whitehat&rsquo;s brother: Digital security or (he&rsquo;s studying at Ferris to join the FBI)
Mr. Macky the linear algebra teacher would like to present
Dr. Al Fuqaha: something
Lazer: TCP-IP
Cowbar: dunno yet
Shubot: history of computers
PHP, MySQL, steganography, making beer, VOIP, evolution of internet


Cameron knows where to shoot people to make them die.

Private WOW server is awesome and free. ccowmu.org/wow to get hooked up! Only people allowed on server are people within two degrees of separation from computer club members. Jen is the highest level on the server who got there legitimately, booya. How to regulate cheating and stimulate economy with so few players has yet to be determined. Removing the level cap would be fantastic. Spacey&rsquo;s idea: make an instance based on the average group level.

Friendship Village
Last Saturday, 11/15, went well. Next date to go is December 5th. You can still sign up to go and help out the old people.

T-Shirts
Shirts have not been ordered yet. Stu will be ordering them ASAP.

Are the access points on-line? We&rsquo;re keeping three and selling the rest individually. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll be sold for $100&#43;.

Lazer spilled two cans of pop on the floor. Now we have to get the carpet cleaned, thanks Lazer.

Whitehat&rsquo;s fundraiser idea: sell blood and semen (A.K.A. Hacking Darwinism) 
Any real fundraiser ideas? Prostitution, selling donuts, selling ethernet cables

MAME Cabinet update
We need money!
Lazer found a 27` for $300

Clean your crap off the work bench please! We need the room.

Moving computer club meetings to a different day next semester:
Discrete structures is Thur. night so many members would have to miss the meetings.  Possibly moving to Thursday at 5:30 (but would still conflict with presentations) or moving it to Wednesday or Friday night.
Tentatively, computer club meetings will be Wednesday at 6:00pm. 

PLAN is THIS SATURDAY
Cokezero and 
Free admission for people who are volunteering at PLAN and half off for CClub members
$15 get you into the PLAN and membership in club

Whitehat&rsquo;s virus presentation is tonight.
Smidget wants to do one when he&rsquo;s in town at the beginning of January.

Drc arrives: 6:15:30pm what a late bastard

Spacey is writing minutes in place of the slacker secretary Jen

Studio - Do we need someone to be an official secretary, or can we just force it upon unsuspecting noobs on a meeting by meeting basis?

Response - Well, unless we want to rewrite our constitution&hellip; and we are kind of lazy, so no.

Second order of business: FRIENDSHIP VILLAGE

Jen arrives: 6:17:30pm. I guess being married to the president conveys a slack sense of duty

We went to friendship village this past saturday for the intro trip, and we will need people for this saturday for another orientation.  Whitehat will go again, so will Grg, Dora will not be able to since she is going to kill bambi.  We can always use more people.  Like last time, we will meet at the CClub office beforehand.

Third order of Business: PLAN X

Sponsorship: edgetechcorp.com might sponsor the cclub in general, but we are attempting to convince them to sponsor Plan X in addition.  As payment we will put a link on our website for their site.  We will get a discount on our purchases from them - more details will be coming soon. Do we want to ask them for a set percentage off?  Thinking at least 25% off.

Kyle will be printing up flyers for the Plan X tomorrow. We should also chalk up the campus in addition, even though it is supposed to rain.

Next order of business: Presentations

Whitehat&rsquo;s presentation!  Computer Virus!

Crowbar is talking about something, but he&rsquo;s quiet and no one is listening.

Jade can possibly do one also.

We need more presentation ideas for the upcoming semester.

Next order of business: Project Kits

Need to clear off the work bench - in part, Move Uber Yakko!
Drc is talking of project kits, no idea what though.  Something about TV Be Gone Kit ($15)

Next order of Business: Uber Yakko Migration

Crowbar - U-Yakko done by Thanksgiving.  Will replace Dot and Yakko (dot - irc, voip, opendpn server)  Web server on yakko again? If so, we are retarded.  Sys logs being sent to Ed&rsquo;s machine.  Rita is also going bad - possibly turning into a Syslog server.

Subtopic: trimming down the access to sudo.  Will also force better passwords for all yakko accounts.  Ideas for sudo trimming: Keep it the way it is, pare it down to only officers/sysadmins, a Tiered system (sudo to some things, but not others depending on role)

Crowbar went back to his corner and keeps trying to talk about important things that we can&rsquo;t hear.

Nxt Order of Business: Fund Raisers

Kyle&rsquo;s idea is wondering if anyone else has ideas. So useful.

Mel&rsquo;s Idea is a Bake Sale (cookies, cookies, etc)
Cost: $3 per 2 batches.  Selling cookies for major profit (1000% profit margin. Even the underwear gnomes didn&rsquo;t have it this good)

Added idea: Also sell hot chocolate / coffee at this bake sale

Next Order of Business: Tie back to old order of business - Rita. Crowbar needs to learn how to project his voice.

Next Order of Business: Solicit some local guy for a presentation about games, cause we all love games.

These orders of business are getting short - we must want to leave

Runt died, Crowbar babbled, no one listened.  Something about replacing Runt with Old Yakko when it&rsquo;s pulled from Parkview

We need a geekout - possibly this weekend after Friendship Village.  Ideas?

Recording: Tim

Meeting began at 6:09 PM


presentations

Sean&rsquo;s presentation is today.  Suggestions have been solicited.  Greg suggests pairing people for presentations.  DrC might do the BASH presentation if we ask him.  Dan suggested a Saturday meeting, possibly for a geekout.  Cameron offered to cover regex.  Trenary offered to do a presentation. 

We need to improve our advertisement.  Tim suggested that we do a series on security.  We could even possibly get the WSA to bring Jay Ball to campus to talk, since he&rsquo;s a professional white hat.  

Cameron would be able to do his on SSH and regex next week.  Ben We. suggested a presentation oriented to SSH, SSL/TLS.  We would like to get Jim Cotton to do a presentation.  

Schedule is as follows:

Cameron - 11/1 - SSH/Regex
DrC - 11/8 - BASH
Sean - 11/15 - Cross-site scripting
Trenary - 11/29 - whatever
Dan - 12/6 - Parallel programming

PLAN

Cameron reported on his tasks.  

Discussion was taken on who would provide the pizza.  Rashad suggested that we
talk to some businesses that would offer free food, such as Pancheros.  Someone pointed out the danger of lots of burritos and geeks in enclosed spaces.

Dan complained about the Herald&rsquo;s advertisement of our presentations.  Dan gets off topic.

Preregistration was discussed.  We had at least 90 pre-registered.  

Advertising was discussed.  We need to modify the fliers, since we forgot the cost on the fliers.  Rashad will redesign the fliers to include the cost tomorrow.  The cost was discussed.  Suggestions include $15.  

Eric arrived.  Eric announces that we have more prizes and fewer people attending.  

Warsow tournament $160 soundcard (1st), $100 sound card (2nd), headset, backpacks, beanies.  
Greg suggested double elimination to give away the headset.

Cameron suggests that we have a separate price for non-tournament players.  Eric indicated that there could be problems in verifying people&rsquo;s membership in tournaments.  Cameron agreed with Eric.

Cameron is talking about how to survey attendees&rsquo; opinions about the PLAN.

Cameron complained about two errant members who were misbehaving.  Ben asked Cameron about Sentinel.  Cameron reports that Sentinel now has it&rsquo;s 3 gigabit NIC cards.  Sentinel will be up next week for testing.

Dan asked for a PLAN committee meeting.

Greg indicated that we could setup a VLAN with the Univ of Ill at Chicago so that we could play games with students at UIC.  

A vote was taken on $15 as the cost.  Yes-9, no-2

Members of the PLAN committee will meet on Friday at 2:00 at the CCLUB office.

Greg wants to do some Facebook ads.  The cost would be $30-50 for one week.  Tim advised that we get preapproval for the ads.  The question is for a max of $50.  The vote was affirmative and unanimous.

Treasurer&rsquo;s report

Cameron believes that we have $800 in savings and $300 in the checking account.

Sudo access

The sysadmin group will discuss developing set guidelines on how to govern who gets SUDO capability as a committee.

Adjourned at 6:48 PM.

        <article class="minute-card" data-year="2007" data-search-content="Meeting Minutes - October 18, 2007 Meetin&rsquo; Started: 18:10.  

Dan Gore is the President?  Mr. Gore inquires if the minute taker is ready to take minutes.  The minute taker confirms his preparedness.  For some reason it is really warm in the club office and Mr. Rancor has disappeared.  That guy!  Lately Mr. Rancor has disappeared from CCLUB meetings. It seems like there is no reason to consider carrying on this conversation, but it is not really a conversations because it is one sided.  So please refrain from posting lude comments on the forum below.  Thank you tmiley.  Gregerg shows up contemplating recompiling his source code slash kernel of Linux.  

Dan Gore is getting antsy about starting the meeting.  We should probably have more PRESENTATIONS.  Dan attempts to write an   so people could submit their ideas, but he suggests that we just utilize email for such communication.  Whitehat chimes in with how lame his presentation is going to be, but for some reason nobody seems to care since his marriage is really stressing him out.  I&rsquo;m sure most men can relate to the utter haste it causes for most of society.  There was a saddened hush that fell over the less than usual Computer Club attendees as Whitehat failed to mention the legality of &ldquo;Sequel Injection,&rdquo; or better called &ldquo;SQL Injection.&rdquo;  (es queue el) Squirrel, or Sequel.  Rancor attempts to clear his tab for the Computer Club drawer.  Yes! We have a cash drawer and we use it.  Come stop by and purchase some goodies for yourself.  Give a mouse a cookie, he asks for a glass of milk.  Dr. Claw owes the drawer one dollar and fifty sense, I mean cents.  

Carlos (C4) is supposed to be doing a presentation on Locksport later on.  

We should talk &lsquo;bout subnettin&rsquo;! Rancor appears grumpy as the magical butterfly flutters in his hair. Who had Jimmy Johns this weekend and left their crap in the club?  We&rsquo;re going to fingerprint everyone unless Greg confesses.  We did receive a new fire extinguisher for our room.  Good thing, in case there is a fire, but Tmiley removed it.  Hopefully we never need a fire extinguisher because we do not have one.  Would someone like to get us a fire extinguisher.  More complimenting on funny XKCD and funneh pics on the internet.  Thank you.  

The PLAN8 LAN PARTY is coming soon.  It should be pretty fun.  WMU Homecoming is this weekend and everyone should go and enjoy themselves.  WMU has a new AD Campaign, it&rsquo;s quite funny.  We&rsquo;re still better than CMU in every way.  (CMU Students, you may email us and we will prove your complaint.)

Jim Cotton should precipitate his knowledge to the world and Whitehat is a snoop.  I hope his wife never causes him to look over her shoulder, because he will probably complain.  I like her a lot.  Thanks babe.  

Mstaff brought the computer club a VGA cable.  What a nice guy.  Hey My Frien&rsquo;!  Would ANYONE LIKE TO DO A PRESENTATION ON PHP!?  BASH = DRC.  Sea Four considers &ldquo;winging&rdquo; his presentation and wishes for a &ldquo;white thing&rdquo; to be there.  Is someone going to advertise the presentations?  We have a director of PR.  In a world of SPAM, the computer club would like to participate, but we would like to not be spammed anymore.  So stop it you Montagues.

We would like to become DEFCON miniatures.  Firewire is so much better than USB.  www.apple.com ==&gt; PLEASE SPONSOR US.  As Cameron considers speaking, the misses enters the room and hinders that idea. Laughter fills the room as he considers running away.  

Dell is threatening to sponsor us.  Note to Apple Inc.: We wouldn&rsquo;t mind an academic sponsorship, nor would we mind testing any of the equipment/ideas/etc. that you would like to invest in.  Cisco is way better in networking than IPTaBLES or anything linkux.  Greg complains about talking about important stuff.  Then we realize we are the computer club.

Red Octane would like to contribute?  That would be fun.  Contact us.  Someone is donating servers?  Rancor is not using his XP box or something because he cannot overclock his USB ports anymore than they already are.  Whitehat sits silently waiting for a nudge from his wife to go mow the lawn.  

We need help &ldquo;Flyering.&rdquo; We need help advertising and /etc/init.d.  Someone suggests calling up the PR director. I would like to eat some Pizza and some Pumpkin Ale.

Thanks!

The projector is flaking out, probably because of the Cat5 or something.  

Stuff we&rsquo;re getting rid of can go to Surplus.  

Nobody emailed the potential new members that signed up at Bronco Bash.  Whitehat suggested that he himself does it.

We wish we could move the office to Parkview, but we prefer this room.  Two offices would be nice, connected with a wormhole.

grg&#43;&#43;

Need some cables.  I have some cables.  

Cameron talks about Coke and Pepsi.  Coke is better. Who is stealing pop? Excel, what is that?  Case deals.  Beer?

Something about hookers and how they are bad.           

Phorce is interested in installing SAP.

Rancor is not here.  Hooray!  Whitehat stares dismally into abyss.  His hair straggly and matted like a dirty tired goat.

we&rsquo;re making a shopping list for stuff, most people want stuff that will make them obese within the year.

Greg wants to put bawls in peoples&rsquo; faces, dan seemed to show interest in the past with related activities.

Projector screen looks good in the new spot, some people think its going to fall, others don&rsquo;t.

rancor&ndash;

It might rain tomorrow at bronco bash, we need to make sure our stuff doesn&rsquo;t get wet while we&rsquo;re out there. We should be able to daisy chain to Wood Hall for power, hopefully we don&rsquo;t get electrocuted.

Cameron is going to take home the mayo thats been sitting in the fridge for quite a while.

dan supports communism/facism

[20 minutes of useless arguing that isn&rsquo;t getting us anywhere]

Meeting Started: 18:30PM

We have our LumenLab eVo Projector set up and pointed at the projection screen.  Greg fixed the projection screen with his mad hat leet skills.  Good job greg!

CClub just got back from DEFCON15! It taught us a lot of stuff.  There are pictures at http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/defcon

We like the idea of Hacker Jeopardy. We should do something like this for a fund raiser.  

Network visualization for PLAN?  Wall of sheep!  Demonstration of hamsterizing and other such fun stuff.  

Greg&rsquo;s wii is on the projector.  Greg is not paying attention to the meeting&hellip; tsk tsk.  Not bad looking on the projector.  Now mstaff is not paying attention to Cameron rambling.  Holy crap the weather thing on the wii looks cool. Crazy legs dan is on - full screen.    

There is an Apple PowerMac G4 Graphite thanks to tmiley.  Probably the best computer in the building next to Dan&rsquo;s MacBook Pro.  

PLAN8 and something&hellip;. shoot.  

Whitehat&ndash; 

Balloon - 1000ft.  Might be a good idea to get this ready for the Bronco Bash.  mstaff and c4 need to get together and put some stuff together to really do some stuff. Parachute cord or something else instead of fishing line.   Drc makes DC motor whine.  We&rsquo;re getting a wench and making her do it.   

Saturday - Geekout - Guess what&rsquo;s on the schedule&mdash; cleaning&hellip; Geeks = Messy

Cameron is hungry.  

Becoming a member of TOOOL.US - we have to make small meetings and take minutes then we might be accepted as a chapter.

It was a lonely summer afternoon as the Computer Cub of WMU began their meeting.  It was today, June 28th, at 6:32 PM that we began seemingly on time.  Albeit Dan, our president was late, extremely late and Tim was nowhere to be found.  Only a feat that drc usually tackles with the naked eye - aligning bits perpendicularly.  Dan enters the glory filled room with a smirk on his face.  The air conditioner is finally fixed and bellowing sweet cold air, finally our data center can resume at optimum conditions.  

PLANB - Waiting on Dr. Greeeeen

Need advertising for PLANB - RANCOR!
Tournament?  What games? PC games.  Counter Strike.  Starcraft, warcraft&hellip; Quake3, just for fun.  Dan suggests that we should not do a serious competition until fall.  

5$ - Free Parking

Sign in and name tags - punch ticket.  Hole punch the name tag.  

Where are the GigE cards?  

OFFICERS MEETING: Saturday 3:00PM 
Need directions.  

VoIP - Get 800 Number.  Asterisk&hellip; waiting on ports&hellip; voicemail - sent to email&hellip; drc should set up 800 number with his ping application.  One company for incoming, one company for outgoing.  

VPN is working. 

DRC SHOWS UP! OpenVPN - Tun/Tap interfaces.  

ParkView
Rita
Yakko

Wiki documentation! Hooray.  drc&#43;&#43; tmiley&#43;-

UDP53 &hellip; nstx&hellip; hehe&hellip;

yakko.cs.wmich.edu

We need some IPs and our own DNS.  

Backing up yakko&hellip; Probably should do something about it.  Once VPN is set up, use kerberos or LDAP to authenticate all computers&hellip; 

Personal backup space, mapped drives.  Storage space.  Hardware vs software RAID&hellip; 

The sysadmin lightens the party with mischief&hellip; 
Here&rsquo;s your ips.  cclub1 and cclub2.  
.77
.78
.203
.204

Humor
&ldquo;Hot Dogs&rdquo;

Treasurer will keep track of usage and bills.  Documentation should be well done.  

LDAP vs pushing files&hellip; drc&ndash;

Cameron is allocating funds to drc for VoIP and it is approved.  Looking for credit card or something.

allocating $48.63 to Cameron for reimbursement for the party. 

Dan donated a whiteboard, thank you Dan.
Greg is also going to donate one, thanks Greg.

Horton offered to find a low end router for us, thank you Horton.

Plan B:
Date: ?  Some time in summer 2  

Schedule for presentations, geekouts.
Greg is building a projector, should we move the screen? People seem to like that idea. Ed is scared to look above the ceiling. This would be a cool geekout project.

Bronco Bash:
We still have our tent, need a location near a building so we can plug our stuff in. We should probably figure out where it&rsquo;s going to be. Construction will probably mean it&rsquo;ll be in the same place as last year. We need some new stuff to show off, like T-shirts. Dan says Bronco Bash would be a good way to pimp tech week.

Tech Week: 
Tim suggests one major speaker. We need to find a way to appeal to the public. Tim volunteered to take charge of the whole deal. Dan suggested trying to hook people with presentations.

The office needs to be cleaned again, despite the fantastic job drc did last time.

Rebuilding library. some of the books are old, but not old enough to be humorous. should we get new books? not sendmail, that would break our shelf.

Dan wants us to have club toys, like a wii. 
Asterisk account would be cool, we&rsquo;ll actually try to get that done asap.
We want to be better buddies with the CS department, apparently they like us too. It was mentioned that almost all of C208&rsquo;s staff are our agents. We could recruit new agents out of C208

We need an officer meeting to schedule and organize stuff. Tenatively scheduled for 6/09

The black box
What do we do with that thing?  What is it&rsquo;s status? It has an OS, but nothing configured.  We are going to use it as a communications device, with VPN, the Asterisk server, and the IRC server.  

Rita is currently registered with OIT, so we can&rsquo;t yet re-register it until it gets deleted at the end of the semester.

A discussion ensued about how DNS worked and how to get Rita registered.

Also discussed was the firewall configuration and why we don&rsquo;t have yakko in the office anymore.  Tim suggested that we move the black box over to the machine room and configure it from there.

Eric proposed that we do a barbecue, using the left over burgers, fries and hot dogs from a previous PLAN.  Cameron offered his house in Battle Creek for a barbecue.  

Cameron suggested the weekend after finals, but a few people objected due to moving.  We are looking at Friday on finals week.

Telephone issues

DrC wants to to retire the WAXYFAT number for the CCLUB.  DrC tells us that he knows of a company that can provide an 800 number for $2.50/month and $25 setup fee.  $0.02/minute incoming/outgoing.  A local number is $5/month and 1/2 cent/minute for incoming/outgoing.  This is through Nufone.  We would also have unlimited incoming channels.

DrC proposed that we vote on getting a telephone number for the CCLUB.  We can choose a vanity number for $25.

We will put the action in for review pending consideration of our finances.  DrC suggested that we can do a prepaid scheme.  Motion tabled until the next meeting.

The CCLUB has a wiki
Dan set it up at http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/wiki.

Present: Tim, Carl, Eric, Craig, Dan, Joe, Sean, Brian (taking minutes)

Began: 6:12pm

Office arrangements - The office has been arranged well for selling concessions again. We have office hours covered pretty well but we could use more people, especially in the morning shift of 8am-10am. Imagine, if you will, weary-eyed students attending their 8am classes&hellip; what better way to wake them up than an ice-cold Bawls. There is some concern that the shelf for food is not stable but we&rsquo;ll throw around ideas in the future about how to secure it.

WSA rep - 2nd call for a WSA rep (no volunteers last week). WSA meetings are 4:15-5:45pm on Wednesdays and are important to attend if we want to get funding for certain events in the future. Sean has volunteered to take up this task.

Treasurer&rsquo;s report - Miles not present, no treasurers report.

LAN party - 6 people indicate a willingness to help. We&rsquo;ll shoot for Saturday, November 11th 12pm-4am provided that everyone stays interested.

Executive Director - Brian
Sponsors - Brian
Concessions - Craig
Tournament Master - Eric
Auxilary Network Engineer - Joe
Advertising - Dan

VoIP phone - Members seemed generally enthusiastic about having a computer club extension. The extension could be set up to simply record to their voicemail box or forward to their actual phone. Special extensions would be set up for officers currently holding positions.

Geekout - Geekouts have become a more official event and are now listed on our website. To help pay for materials, we discussed the idea of charging $5 for attendees. There were 4 votes for the movement and 3 against so we will hold off untel we can discuss this more.

Concessions for the office - Bawls were purchased from Imperial Beverage in Kalamazoo. We bought 5 cases with 24 cans (16 oz) per case. Members will go shopping tomorrow or Saturday for new candy and other drinks for the club office. We are running dangerously low on several items and are completely out of the essentials&hellip; like Skittles. Craig will provide the Sam&rsquo;s Club membership. We did not set a budget but Tim will go with to keep things within limits.

Seating - We want to buy a couch (or even two) for the club office. A brief look on craigslist lists 2 decent-looking couches at $50 a piece and another at $125. We voted and all members were in favor of a $150 limit to purchase seating this weekend.

The next one might be a basic PLAN for free instead of a larger PLAN.
We&rsquo;re not going to aim at advertising.
This one will be based on just networking and having fun.
Discussion involving transfering the responsibilities of the LAN were in order.  Tim M. ask who would be willing to take on the responsibilities.

We are thinking June 10th, 10am to 12am, this is the ideal time we want to do the PLAN.
There is also 24th and 25th for dates.
July 1st is also a tentative date for the PLAN.

Final decision: PLAN B will be on July 1st, Brian F will e-mail the Dean.

LAN Party news:
We need to determine if we will be doing a LAN party.this summer.  We had problems with the network because OIT did
something to the network.  We are thinking of thoroughly testing the Network before the PLAN.
Million Frag Lan will be in the middle of June, we may not be able to find a decent time to do our next LAN.

Anyone who would be willing to speak for their position next week, will do so.

tacos.
more tacos.
Needless rambling, idividuals are going on about their classes.
Yakko has been updated. (updated hard ware, etc.)
Joe W. Wants the firewall swapped already so we can get a VPN to the office up.
The computer club office now has 2 machines. One machine is a NAT firewall, the other machine is designated for more pratical uses.
The NAT has dual displays and processors.  The pratical machine contains a Geforece 4MX 420, and has a sound card routed into an old stereo with house speakers on shelves.
This was done to promote use of the office, and make the office a more comfortable environment for office hours.
Soon we&rsquo;d like to NAT the office to YAKKO so we can have share mounted remotely using NFS.

New user creation script needed
We need a script that will do the following, not necessarily needed over the web.
It needs to do the following:
-create user
-Set the home directory
&ndash;date = /home/(sum, fal, win)(year)/(name)
-expiration
-password
-home dir/web dir owner ship/chmod.
-group
-automatic blog creator? see below.
-mail the &rsquo;new-user&rsquo; e-mail to the users supplied e-mail address (Not yakko).

Joe G. is creating a website &ldquo;Planet Yakko&rdquo; for individuals who don&rsquo;t already have WebBlogs.
His invision is to have blog applications for all of the users.
The planet site should &lsquo;aggregate&rsquo; the blogs to create a central site for blogs.
Brian has schedules for the tournaments for the PLAN.
This can be found hopefully on www.whatistheplan.com

Widr was down yesterday, because Joe W. Turned the master volume up.  There is no understanding of why this has happened, however if left the way it is now, noone should have need to touch it. Phorce P managed to repair it.

Joe W. wants to know what kind of local sponsorship we should have.
Supposedly bust buy.
It appears no students showed for the meeting tonight, looks like we are calling it a night.
we hope the times will be the same, or longer, since the night time is more appealling to individuals.
hoping for:
9-1 sat. 8-12 sun.

Friday.  We need more Bawls.  We need extra coolers.  2005-05-19">

Brian attempted to reserve LAN rooms
Still need to follow up.  We have some flyers at
http://www.whatistheplan.com/flyers.  We want to post flyers earlier than usual
in order to get more interest built up.  We&rsquo;ll also advertise online.

We are trying to reserve from Friday to Sunday on that week.  It will be a
multi-day event.  We need to get into the other room to get the port numbers
for the reservation of the other script.  We are have interest in an Xbox
room. 2005-05-12">

Plan A
Rooms not reserved.  Brian was to reserve the room.  We were shooting
for the 25th (we think).


The next meeting will be May 5th.
We will likely be discussing Plan A.  Meetings will be at 7:00 PM in weeks
when there will be class.  


Matt and Miles will need keys
The two new officers have been instructed to go to the CS department office and
check out keys for the Computer Club office. 2005-04-14">

PLAN
We need to be there friday to take inventory and test all ports for function.
Who is going to be there?  Joe, Brian and Eric are committed.  It&rsquo;s at 7:00 PM.

We will arrive at 8:00 AM.  Problem: We still haven&rsquo;t confirmed with Jim
Cotton.  If that VLAN script doesn&rsquo;t run, we will have MAJOR issues.  Joe will
continue trying to contact him. 2005-03-24">

been contacted.  Melissa and Eric have again agreed to provide food, but are
scaling it back this time.

Firewall report
It has a prompt, so it&rsquo;s good.  We need a 16 bit networking card.  We can
continue to look for PCI cards or put in a different machine.  Nik offers a
Celeron 300.  Tim suggests we check Marvin for a 16 bit NIC. 


Flyer for lan party
It was denied.  It did not say that it was sponsored by the Computer Club.
Oops.  We had a whole bunch of flyers last time.  Joe G. asks for other
designs.  Please remember to include date, price, organization, location. 2005-02-24">

Gratitude to Tim, Tim&rsquo;s dad, Isaac, Chris and Joe for the work in the
office.
The office now has shelf space and it looks really nice.  Some books, sadly,
were thrown out.  So we do know how to sacrifice.  Several &lsquo;70&rsquo;s area theses
hit the trash.


The LAN party rooms are officially reserved.  
We need ports for the room for VLANing on the day.  We will also need the ports
for the spillover space.  We will need to have Computer Club staff in the
spillover room if we need it. 2005-02-03">

Mail
Problem occurred between OIT, CS and Yakko.  Ed fixed.  Mail from CS is working
now as well.  Sendmail was doing strange things.  Mail was going in and coming
out, but we don&rsquo;t know where it was going.

Mail loops are not good!  Hal now knows how to deliver mail to yakko.


Webpages
Apparently, SSL is working, but there is more to do with the SSL aliases which
were not ported from the old yakko.  Ed is trying to organize it all. 2005-01-27">

The new yakko server
The server is serving.  Joe commends us for a fantastic job.  We migrated in 3
days and we&rsquo;re back to 90%.  We still need to fix mail.  It was working, but
now it&rsquo;s stopped.  We can send mail and transmit/receive within the Univ.
Joe suggests that we have POed the OIT department and must talk to them.

Joe will talk to OIT tomorrow, if it is not found to be a configuration
problem. 2005-01-20">

Our microwave DIDN&rsquo;T vanish
Anyone need an old, heavy radioactive microwave?  Also, other junk needs to
disappear.  Joe wanted the lamp to disappear, but was outvoted.


We have temporary shelving.
Joe developed a temporary solution to the problem of lack of shelving by using
our problem of too many worthless books to our advantage.  


Webpage needs updating
Tim was reminded that he agreed to be the new webmaster.  Tim vigorously denied
ever saying such a thing.  A few complaints were registered about
non-functional mysql server and needs for more current updating. 2005-01-13">

Thanks to Tim and Joe for unteryakko.
Joe and Tim installed a new machine under the Debian OS.  It&rsquo;s accessible via gasiorek.homelinux.com.  To gain access, contact Joe.  Isaac and Joe purchased some material.  

Isaac and Joe were paid.


Renewal checks have been received from several members.
Accounts have been updated for these members.


The individual running the PCI graduate profile project contacted Joe.
This is regarding a new list that Joe has been setting up for their group.  Issues were resolved regarding adding users to the list.  Mailman&rsquo;s configuration options were causing problems, and Joe discovered that Mailman&rsquo;s configuration options don&rsquo;t make sense. 2005-01-06">

The microfridge exploded.
The fridge was set too high and the pops in the fridge exploded.  Eric is
cleaning it.


New case fans for yakko.
They&rsquo;re about $6 each.  The current ones are starting to complain.

We are registered with SOAP.
The computer club is now antibacterial.  It is a way to automatically
re-register us rather than having to file with the OCL every year.

a good idea, but Joe voiced concerns about the possibility of bad weather. 2004-11-18">

Do we want to do it again?  Yes.  We want to have Jan 29th as a tentative date.

general consensus was that it&rsquo;s not doable at this time.

Tournaments will be for Doom 3 and UT2k4.  16 player double elimination.  It
will be tight, so we will need dedicated servers to be running the whole time.
Prizes will include $50 gift cards for Best Buy.  It might be crazy due to the
time constraints.  Brian has developed a time structure.  Joe asks for a copy
of the schedule. 2004-10-28">

We plugged in wakko.

be somewhat lacking.  Joe complained about the lack of space in the office.


Eric suggested that we put a notice in the Glances in the Western
Herald.
Ed revealed his fascination with cron jobs.

The little fridge is dead.  
Eric proposes that it be thrown out, since it has a large colony of mold which
has taken up residence in the fridge and will probably never be worthy of being
used.  Motion carries.


The dates are being changed for the presentations. 
Eric will present on basic unix next week.  Tim will follow with debugging
techniques and Joe will follow on Linux GUIS.  The web site has been changed to

Club representatives met with Dr. Guizani and talked to him about space for the club on the new campus. He said he&rsquo;s very willing to help in any way he can and asked for a list of every service we&rsquo;ve ever provided so it can be presented to the Dean of engineering. Dr. Guizani would like to push our tutoring services for computer science and engineering. If this doesn&rsquo;t work we will have to meet with the dean ourselves.  2003-02-20">

If the club doesn&rsquo;t secure a new office in Kohrman Hall, there is a chance that we could be withouat an office once the space here in Dunbar is reallocated 
It seems that there was a presentation yesterday about an embedded platform that was mostly software related. We are thinking about setting up a mailman account so that we will be notified of any and all presentations that will interest the members of the computer club. Efforts will be made to increase ties between engineering and computer science here on campus. We will try to find the presenter to see if it would be possible to have the presentation given here.   2003-01-30">

Status of Yakko: It&rsquo;s ZIF socket melted and there was a psychedelic  dreamshow and now we&rsquo;re stuck with unteryakko until we get a new mobo and ram (potentially), and a new CPU. 
The debate now is whether our replacement board will be a dual-Athlon board. The consensus seems to be against getting a dual-Athlon board because it&rsquo;d be a waste of our money.  2002-03-28">

This Saturday we&rsquo;re going to begin cleaning the office at approximately 11:00 am and we&rsquo;re going to get food.  Part of the cleaning involves making the room presentable for inspection by the department.  That may involve taking down the Christmas lights! NOOOO!!

The following week we&rsquo;ll want to have a Linux install party (with new rules). 
Speaker: Wes heard from him in December and recommended a date but hasn&rsquo;t heard back from him yet. Tentatively it was February 12-14 that we&rsquo;re planning on his presentation.  We want to have at least two weeks to publicize so first we definitely need to tack down a date.  2002-01-10">

PayPal policy change: no credit card transfers so we&rsquo;re going to drop our PayPal account.  We&rsquo;ll see what kinds of surcharges they have though. 
Laptop rant: Wes is looking for a laptop without XP on it.  In other words, he&rsquo;s looking for an Affordable Computer. 
Partition Magic and Windows XP are not very compatible when you install XP off of a recovery disk. So the plan is to check out the newer version of Partition Magic, possible via funding from GSAC. Reminder: Get quote and request funding from GSAC in December  2001-11-01">

We are going to try to setup a Q&amp;A session for when the new chair gets in and starts working. A lunch meeting with him may be nice too. 
Wes is going to be moving after this semester.  He found a USB webcam that works in Linux.  He&rsquo;s offered to setup Icecast and a donated Webcam and a microphone so that we can stream meetings and Wes can see them from where he&rsquo;s moving.  He will donate the webcam in exchange for the mounting brackets on the back of our rack-mount hub.  2001-10-11">

Holland Public Schools is disbanding a department and are auctioning  off computer hardware that isn&rsquo;t much older than a year.  We&rsquo;re looking  for officers to go to the auction and try to get us good stuff.

Status of new webpage design: Isaac was working on stuff but he&rsquo;s not here.  He was working on the graphics and when that&rsquo;s done Wes will work on the PHP part.

Bronco Bash is coming.  We&rsquo;ve sent in our spot request (early, imagine that!).  We&rsquo;ll give away free CDs and happiness.  A webcam we would be nice to set up at Bronco Bash.  Bronco Bash is on the first day of class on Monday. 

 Business cards, flyers, giant business cards, etc. would be cool.  It must all have the &#34;Fight Club&#34;-like logo.  The business cards will be like the  flyers but not as extravagant... and smaller.  Deciding what we&#39;re going to smash:  Computers, definitely the Mac.  All of our junk.  We have to be concerned about people&#39;s safety.  We could get a pick-axe or a hammer... but Matt says something one-handed.  We need free stuff to give away and sell at Bronco Bash.  We&#39;ll talk to Wes and see if the KLUG can&#39;t cook something up for us.  OS CDs as well as software that can be installed on the operating systems!  We were going to have T-shirts as well.  People at the table should be wearing the shirts, but we could also sell T-shirts.  We need to look into places that can make these shirts for us at an affordable price.    2001-07-12">

Erik&rsquo;s going to keep trying to get Bionic Arm to whip up some CDs and maybe make a theme song for the computer club. 
Vouchers are in for Uberyakko, people who pitched in should be getting payed soon. 
Bob was talking about the Geek Group.  How&rsquo;d they get their own building? They like playing with Tesla coils.  They get their money from having a legit business that makes big bucks.  Wes was curious about how we could learn from them so that the computer club could eventually get a building of their own.  2001-04-12">

Movie part at pacd&rsquo;s.         This will happen at a time determined in last weeks minutes.     I looked it up.  It is April 21 at 7:00 p.m.     Directions are as follows: 
Location: 626 Summer Street     Time: Approx 7:00 pm     Date: Friday, April 21st     Considerations:     - Pleaes park in the street (not the driveway)     - bring your own beverages (alcohol, pop, tea, whatever)&ndash;we may pick up some 2 liters but I can&rsquo;t gurantee it     -pizza will be provided     - the movies selection is up in the air (look for something sci-fi)                           Directions:                            From downtown: Take Kalamazoo avenue West (away from BL-94 towards US-131), keep in the right lane.  The road forks, take it right (you&rsquo;re now on Douglas), hang a left at the stop light (you are now on North), take a left on the first street, which is Summer St.  The house is 3rd on the left, grey, kind of big and crappy looking.                             From Campus: Take Stadium towards downtown, keep left.  Get in the lane that goes to Elm Crossover and take that over to Elm.  Take elm north and then hang a left on Kalamzoo ave (see above for the rest of the story).                                                        Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t get a real map drawn&hellip; there was just no time (you can probably pull one up on mapquest if you need it).                                                                                 2.

o Pop and candy prices are debating being raised. Isaac says pop should stay  the same since there isn&rsquo;t even a pop machine in this building. Much debate  ensues. The candy is more expensive and makes more of a dent; people REALLY  NEED TO STOP EATING AND THROWING CASH IN WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT! Even if  we make an cash/inventory flow sheet, people are going to have to track each  and every sale&hellip;there is no substitute for getting your ducks in a row.  Ozz wishes to track the problem for a month and see how bad it is before we  decide on a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; that might end up backfiring. After all, as long as  we&rsquo;re not losing hand over fist, it&rsquo;s just good will/advertising for us. So  the accounts will be tracked for a month starting with the next store run,  and we&rsquo;ll have another report at the end of the summer.  1999-06-17">

Bring money for food, Battletech, and whatever else we come across (museums, miscellaneous). Bonnie needs names and SS numbers for all who will be going, so get this to me if you haven&rsquo;t already. I have 13 so far, give or take some; the van supposedly seats 15. Who wants to drive? I suppose I can drive if Tim hasn&rsquo;t had enough sleep, but I&rsquo;ll need a map and a navigator&hellip;Darron&rsquo;s nominated. Give us suggestions for things to do; Tim wants to hit the Three-Story Bookstore&hellip; Good places to eat, for instance.  1998-02-26">

Steve: Officers still needed. At the end of this meeting we&rsquo;ll do more temporary nominations. 
Chicago trip still looks good. At last count I had about ten people who were interested. Remember, non-club members are welcome, just let me know. Final headcount is necessary to determine if extra vehicle(s) are needed. 
Tim: I&rsquo;ll make calls to reserve the van. I believe 14-15 can be fit in it. Is there anything else?  Everyone bring money. Bookstores, Museum of Science and Industry&hellip; Battletech is something like $11/person. Would be nice to have some non-videogame things for the girlfriends coming along&hellip;  1998-02-19">

6:15pm, we start. 
Steve: I got email from Mike Martins, assistant to Diether. I had mailed him asking about the webpage situation. His response is that Diether and he want to resolve this within the next couple of weeks, and he will get back to me when a date and time have been sent. Dr. Kapenga sent everyone his proposal for equipment, which dramatically undercut everyone else&rsquo;s estimate (by a factor of ten or so!), which apparently weighed heavily in their decision. I think the meeting will boil down to sheer policy. I&rsquo;ll be there, as will Tim; Kapenga and Trenary should show also. Unknown if Dr. Wright will be there &ndash; he has no relation to us, he passed the buck to Diane Schwartz, so we shall see.  1998-02-12">

Office hours.  Everyone mailed.  That looks good, since the crucial hours 12-1 are covered.  If you need to add more or change them, talk to steve. Steve will print up something to hang on door. 
Chicago trip.  Tentative March 7th, last sat of the spring break.  The spring break starts Mar 2 and resume 9th.  Most people will be probably back by then.

Steve: once again the cry goes out for officers, for every position. The officer training program is in effect so people can work with the old before they assume the new. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know what the duties are, or wants more information, can either read the Club Constitution on our web page, http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/general/new.const or ask any existing officer who holds a position you&rsquo;re interested in.

Dave Bocek is a presidential candidate for WSA for next year.  Floor yielded to Dave. 


2) Officers: we need new officers to take over for next year.  Steve and Dennis are leaving, Darron and Tim have done everything already.  Basically, we are creating officer training program for CCLUB.  We are looking for recruits or getting more involved will be asked to talk to Steve and help them with questions.  Try to get people interested in certain position and get them acclimatized to their responsibility and insure continuity.  The more you do, the more confident you get.    1998-01-22">

Steve: Not much this week. I still need office hours. If you don&rsquo;t have a key and would like to hold one, let me know and one can be copied for you, or we can set one as a floating key again. 
We need new officers! If you will be around next year&hellip; I&rsquo;d like to have &ldquo;officer training&rdquo; for those who might be nervous about taking on the responsibility; folks can tag along behind current officers and see how things are done. Attendance in general is down, and fresh blood would be appreciated. Being an officer isn&rsquo;t too hard, and it&rsquo;s a great way to get more involved with the club. As far as I know we have nobody interested in being President, Vice President, etcetera&hellip; I know I can&rsquo;t think of anyone who wants my job , but we NEED officers; it&rsquo;s what makes us a student organization and not just a bunch of folks who sit around drinking pop and playing on computers. I&rsquo;ll be graduating this spring along with other folks,   1998-01-15">

6:10pm. we&rsquo;re off! 
Steve: While I have most all the keyholders here, whoever has not yet gotten back to me about holding office hours should now do so. We&rsquo;ve got 10-4 covered with three people, we would love more, so please mail me your availabilities ASAP. The assembled coursepacks are here in the office. I made 40 total, we&rsquo;ve sold 11 or 12 so far. When we&rsquo;re down to one box, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see how many more we&rsquo;ll need &ndash; Pietkowski said he had 47 students registered. As of now we have almost paid for the copies. All monies received, cash or check, go in their own envelope separate from the normal cash box, which Dennis will be depositing every day or two. Make change from the envelope if possible, if not, please note discrepancies. Coursepacks are 40 bucks. Pietkowski is very much in favor of doing this with us again&hellip;BUT&hellip;  1998-01-08">

Steve talked to herald about article councerning our recent brouhaha about the whole incident involving Wright and get any progress on the web issue and the recent snooping.  Dr. Trenary set up meeting with Dr. W. and at the last  minute, he cancelled.  Dr. T and Steve were annoyed.  Email exchanges occurred  recently claiming that &ldquo;students think they have a god given right&hellip;&rdquo; and   pungent quotes from Dr. W and other misc. stupid comments.  Steve Told Herald  that Dr W has been unwilling to work with us or talk to us.  Dr. T has also  been snubbed, all meetings cancelled.  Whole mood of article is Wright&rsquo;s  unwillingness to meet and discuss issue.  No one should be happy about his  attitude.  Dr W claims he was quietly working behind the scenes to help set up  web issues.  Steve wants to hear what Dr W tells Emily from Herald.   Emily was very responsive and interested in the situation.  1997-12-04">

It would be a great fund raiser, but if people can&rsquo;t come in and get them, it will make the club look bad and make our clients (profs) peeved. After I speak with him, I&rsquo;ll see exactly what he has; I know he has at least one big one of 150-200 pages.

This weekend, those officers with webpages who would like to set them up, then this Monday we announce it. necessary administration has been made pretty easy for us (password changes on yakko.cs.wmich.com need to be manually done by us).  1997-10-09">

 -- the other day we got a call from jim ridge, in charge of the soapbox     derby. he&#39;d heard through the grapevine that we used to run the soapbox     derby times, and he says that now they&#39;re going to start doing it again     and it needs some timers. If we are available to do the timing and it&#39;s     something we&#39;d like to do, he&#39;d appreciate it.      - does anyone still know how to use this equipment?  1997-10-02">

Mr. Wright - he is blowing us off.  Dr. Trenary has been calling him and so has steve, to no avail, apparently he is on vacation, a vacation of heretofor unprecedented length(sic).  So, we are going to go on the offensive.  Jay is going to be calling channel  3 to see about some coverage.  Tim and Steve are going to visit the ombudsman to discuss this matter, along with the fact that our cclub accounts have been deep-sixed because of some harmless software that was running, and, once again, have not recieved any notification as to WHY it happened.  1997-06-07">

The scoop about our web space : 	-Monday, yakko was booted off the network for 5 hours some 	 time in the morning.  Dr. Nelson later informed Ken Theis 	 to remove our web pages per order of Richard Wright.   	 Apparently, a directive was issued 5 years ago stating 	 that student web pages are restricted due to bandwidth  	 problems.  However, finding this documentation seems to  	 be a problem.   	-The k-12 parent : 	   Basically, all this was started by a parent searching the 	   web (we think key-wording sex or nudity whatever) and  	   running across a C-Club members OWN home page in which a 	   tasteful black and white photo of THEMSELF was posted.  She 	   became irate and called Richard Wright.  From here, he passed  	   judgment, claiming that he hadn&rsquo;t known about our web 	   page activities, and issued a disable command through 	   to Dr. Nelson.        	-Bandwidth issues : 	   The university is currently connected to a T1 line that 	   connects us to the internet and has a trans rate of 1.544 	   million bits per second.  The word is that this line is  	   operating at only about 30%.   	-Wright&rsquo;s decision : 	     He seems to think that all the traffic goes through 	   tigger, slowing it down, slowing the modems down and 	   taking up too much disk space on tigger. 	     He wants to moves us to the DOSAWEB server in the            office of student services if we are to even have a            web page.              Basically he doesn&rsquo;t want us to have our own web space 	   for student accounts.  We can keep Yakko&rsquo;s web page, but 	   that is it for right now.  He doesn&rsquo;t think it is fair for 	   us to have pages and not everyone else.  So for 6 months 	   until the University can offer student web pages, we won&rsquo;t 	   be able to activate ours, maybe not at all, since the  	   university won&rsquo;t have control over our pages. 	-Our immediate response : 	   Tim, jay and others within the C-Club immediately got on 	   the phone trying to get in touch with Wright.  When  	   contact was finally reached a day and 1/2 later, Wright 	   was not too friendly, nor willing to talk reasonably to  	   either jay or tim.  We are also in touch with channel 3,  	   the Western Herald, soon the Kalamazoo Gazette, students 	   from various Universities, and CS faculty. 	   Letters have been written and delivered to Diether Haenicke 	   and various others concerning this matter.  Yakko&rsquo;s  	   web pages has gotten a complete overhaul,      1997-03-20">

Programmer will be responsible for making the program that stops the simulation periodically to offer to let the subject play the game.  The game must play for either 5 minutes, or until the subject stops the game.    Interested programming students may contact Grainne Matthews at 349-2314.  1996-03-07">

Care-a-van    We agreed that we will not be able to continue the project until after school is back in session, due to project member conflicts. 
Motherboard    DX4-120 available from strange named place costs $180.  We will ask for 512k of cache.  We could also try safer suppliers for larger companies.  PC Importers and Global are good.  Hard drive cost ~$300.  Tim says we have about $1000 in the bank, so we should have enough money to purchase the motherboard.    Safer retailers would cost about $250.  We would like to upgrade the motherboard at the same time as the hard drive.  We voted to purchase the motherboard.  1996-02-22">

Hard drive    Found hard drive.  Which one do we want?  Western Dig. or Seagate?  Western Digital was chosen.  Jay will order the drive.  This drive is a 1.6G drive. 
Keys    Nelson ok&rsquo;d keys.  Keys must be returned by the end of the semester.  They are on order now.  They will be at DPS within 5 business days.  We may use floater keys.  The secretary agreed to check it out from the CS office.  1996-02-01">

Graphics project    John is interested in doing graphics/sound project.  Jay suggests a logo for the group.  We may wish to make our web pages more readable as well.  John has no specific items in mind.  Jay has some experience with POV.      The projects would probably be computation-intensive, so running on Yakko would not be wise.  Tim asks, &ldquo;What can POV do?&rdquo;  Jay explains it uses a 3 dimensional universe consisting of objects of various geometric objects to construct an image and you tell the camera position to produce movement.    Suns would be a good thing to use.  We could also use Multi-process POV and we could use Grog system to multiprocess image.    Jay offers his research account for parallel processing and POV.  His research account is designated for that use.    Suggested projects includes a map of Western for tracing.  Even more interesting (grant possibility) could be a walk-through for directing newbies around campus using kiosks.    It might take a month to enter the data and another month(?) to render.    Tim works for Geography department and will check on a very accurate campus map.  Very high or very low quality, depending on time you have to render it.    The mapping could be split up into parts, with each of the participating members mapping out a building or terrain.  We have a choice of frontends on different architecture.    We need a topographical map of the campus to produce the example.    We would like to do Dunbar, Dalton, Sprau, Miller, Brown, Fountain, and Shaw.  We should check into getting copies of maps from Campus planning and get building dimensions.  1996-01-25">

Care-a-van needs assistance with their Windows/DOS setup.  They need to install Novell Netware, set up some batch files, and install software.    Nick, Bryan, Tim and Matthew offered to assist with the installation.      We have helped them on previous occasions and money was involved.  1996-01-18">

We may not be able to rely on them to fab the boards
Kahrl and aerospice have been looking into stenciling the SMT components to do it manually
Unfortunately work that was done on the small blacktop parts did not work as well as we were hoping
Buyback has been established at $30, we may lose money on this one.
May move to JLCPCB for future fabrications
Dr. Gupta may send out email to alumni let them know we are looking for blacktop buybacks

STEM Fair

Febuary 9th in the Bernhard Center in the Ballroom from 10am to 1pm, virtual is 3-6pm
Employers may be different at both so it may be worth going to both
Online requires registration

Denso coming back

Cafe Critque is a good way for resume critiquing
Hiring managers will come talk to you about how to make your resume better
You will want to bring a printed out version of your resume
You can also email your resume to wmuhandshake@wmich.edu and have it reviewed that way
In person is generally recommended for better feedback

Career Zone

Career zone is open and is good for resume critques
They will try to help you find internships or jobs after graduation
Always a good idea to get your resume reviewed

Pi Day

March 14
It is a big fundraiser day for all RSOs through engineering department
All money that is donated during that event goes straight to RSO
A pie eating contest is also being pushed very heavily
There are prizes depending on donations
If you know someone who wants to donate please let them know

Student Events

Open houses for students that are already incoming to Western.
One upcoming one is for Honors College students in particular
Scott is out with COVID so we may have a bit of a delay in what we need
1/28 has a bunch of new students, so be nice to them

Western Weekend

WMU holding new event on April 2nd, this is a Saturday
We don&rsquo;t really know what it is but we should be prepared to participate, it may be a recruiting event
It will be held at the bernhard

Science Olympiad

Weekend of March 19
Middle and High Schoolers will be taken to Western to do small science projects
Our event will be called &ldquo;WiFi Lab&rdquo;
This is the first time we will be doing this event.
You get a free tshirt for showing up and working

Blacktops

Kharl is putting together manufacturting plan with Stryker for blacktops
These should really help students in 2230
We will have to make choice on how many we need to make
80 will be need to cover this semester and summer classes, 140 will be needed for adding fall semester
Semi Conducter shortage is making this quite a bit harder than it should be.
Many circuit boards have already been made but we need to populate boards with parts
There is a lot of decision making that needs to be made in #officers for this decision
Stryker has been very useful in this project
Stryker is using newer pick and place robots that need a new file format that KiCad does not produce
Kharl should be able to send new panel design to Stryker
Hopefully Stryker should be able to complete board manufacturing automatically as well.
Will need to do another solder party to solder and test boards.

Synth

We are currently building a modular synth
This is an analog synth that is composed of multiple modules to generate music
They are generally put into a rack similar to a server, allowing you to hook the signal generators and modifiers together to make interesting sounds
We should start putting it together soon.
It would be cool to take it to Bronco Bash and show new students music that was made by a machine club built

Lockpick Set

Flay will be sending us a new lockpicking kit so we can teach lockpicking again

Hackathon

Hosting hackathon in early April

Migration

We are currently working on migrating chat, vault, website, and wiki.
After chat is moved we will wipe dot, allowing us to host other stuff using the machine
Waiting for ccawmu.org domain transfer from typo, for now he can manually enter DNS records
Migration is going to server on Linode instead of locally.
We may be able to request money from school to pay for costs.

Linux Install Party

Next week we will be doing a Linux install party.
This is a very good idea for any students in 2230 or 3240
This is a good idea for any other students that are not in 2230 or 3240 as well.

Academic Integrity Committee Member Needed

The AIC basically make the final verdict on cheating/misconduct charges
As a member you would:

Regularly serve on five-member Academic Integrity Hearing Panels (AHIPs), each composed of three faculty members and two students, to hear charges of academic dishonesty and determine whether the charges have merit.  (These hearings are currently taking place virtually until further notice.)


Provide a minimum of 6 business hours per week (8am-5pm, Monday-Friday) of general availability to serve on AIHPs in 2&#43; hour blocks of time.  Panelists are assigned to AIHPs based on their availability and are notified approximately one week in advance by email if they have been scheduled to serve.  They are sent hearing information to review before they arrive.
Attend a virtual training session on Thursday, February 4 or Friday, February 5.
Based on past statistics, each student would serve an average of 2-3 times per year

Kahrl is leaving

Kahrl will be going to New Mexico
If you need to reach him his email is f.allin.kahrl@wmich.edu

Paypal

Name on the club Paypal account needs to be changed if we want to get commercial use out of if.
We will need this done to do things like swipe credit cards at plan.
Tank and Kahrl are currently working on this issue

PLAN Fall 2017

We need to start looking for plan sponsors.
We also need to set a date.
We are looking for volunteers to help run events and concessions

Passport day

Usually happens a week before the semester.
Good opportunity to draw new members to club
We should unify as a club as to what chat to use before this day so we can send a clear message to new members
We are looking for volunteers to help with this event

Positions

We are still looking for webmaster and VP of finance
Let an eboard member know if you are interested

Server related issues

The plan is to put OpenStack on jazz.
Every shell account would be given its own instance with nothing else on the instance.
VPS access can be provided on SysAdmin approval(hellbacon)
We should think about getting more RAM for system which would upgrade it to 64GB
I am talking to hellbacon about putting out an official updated State of the Server

IRC?

The thought is that we should reinstate irc on our servers as our club chat
Is there any objection?
Switching chats in the summer might not stick.
Irc is a good long term solution.
Slack has its perks such as ease of use for new memeber.

Talk to WSA

We should persue the WSA for funding to have alumni to come talk in Cclub

Yakko Server Status

For the last two weeks, the Computer Club yakko server has not had access to Western Michigan University&rsquo;s network.
Earlier today there was a meeting with Jason Johnson about the conditions needed for yakko to be re-added to the network.

stringy, typo, sphinx, flay, hellbacon, and kami were our representatives at the meeting.


There were some requirements set for the server to be reconnected to the network (These rules will apply to all servers in the Computer Science network).

Jason Johnson will have a sudo account with all privileges.

This condition has already been met and he now has a local sudo account.


Logging will be used on the server.

Due to missing logs at the time of the incident, we would need to make sure logging is working in order for the Computer Science department network to remain secure.


A list of all sudoers on yakko with phone numbers and contact information will be supplied to Jason Johnson.

This list will be required to always be up to date.
This is to test for security on a weekly basis.


A list of ports and services used by the server will be supplied.


A formal document describing the requirements for this policy will be available soon.
This policy will be given to us and to all other server owners on the Computer Science network in order for the department to keep their network secure.
This policy was put in place to prevent any similar situations from happening in the future.
The reason the investigation details were not known at first was because information could not be risked to be given to the person that was responsible for the server security issues.
It is hopeful that very soon the server will be brought back online after all of these requests are properly met.
We would like to thank the support of Computer Club members, Dr. Trenary, and Dr. Carr for helping us get through this situation.

Why the Server Was Down

As it turns out, the actions of giggles accidently caused yakko to be temporarily removed from the Western Michigan University network.

It started when giggles was fired from his job at the Geosciences department without being given a chance to transfer administrator accounts to his replacement on the 31st of March.
In an attempt to resolve this issue, giggles accessed the Geosciences servers through an established ssh connection from yakko to transfer information to College of Arts and Sciences Technology Services on the 2nd of April.
Due to an Active Directory Administrator password being changed by Geosciences, their entire file server was rendered inaccessible. The open ssh connection to yakko was noticed which led to a security emergency and OIT contacted the Computer Science department to ask for yakko to be removed from the network on the 3rd of April.
giggles had a meeting with the Director of IT at the College of Arts and Sciences and was told that two of the passwords he gave were incorrect due to them accidentally being swapped.
giggles was then able to help them reaccess their file servers on April 5th.
The OIT investigation was extended because yakko was misconfigured and did not have logs at the time of the investigation.


The full report written by giggles can be found at: https://gist.github.com/blakewrege/0da98dc1ed1b58efdbc47af820d48633.

Nominations

Before we started the nominations, kami has made a suggestion for the future officers to create an Alumni Ambassador position which could act as a mediator between alumni and students.
President Nominations: sgtsarcasm, kahrl, dolphin, cpg, and leech.
Vice President Nominations: zurek, dolphin, mobyte, sgtsarcasm, leech, and hellbacon.
Treasurer Nominations: tank, dolphin, twitch, mobyte, yillivs, and kharl.
VP of Finance Nominations: leech and kahrl.
Secretary Nominations: mobyte, hellbacon, and cookie.
At next week&rsquo;s meeting, the elections will be held.

If you would like to submit an absentee vote, please try to contact a Computer Club officer through Facebook, the backup IRC server, or Slack.


Each candidate will present a speech at the elections as usual and there will be a discussion before voting for each position.
Good luck to all of the nominees!

PLAN

Everyone had a great time at PLAN last weekend. We cleaned up everything last Sunday and had many successful tournaments.
We have noted that 70 people attended the event over the weekend.
Additionally, after counting up all of the numbers, we have made $500 from this Spring&rsquo;s PLAN!
Thank you to everyone in Computer Club that volunteered to make this event possible!

Server

kami has informed us that the server could possibly be back soon after an internal incident has happened.
For the time that our server is down, anyone is welcome to join us on slack at: https://ccawmu.slack.com/join.
The situation is currently being taken care of and more details will come soon.
Until that happens, it has been requested that everyone stays calm and avoids overreacting to any rumors.
It has been requested:

Do not attempt to force any individuals to give you information.
Do not attempt to force any individuals to take action.
Do not assume any speculation as fact.
Do not take action into your own hands.
Do not be insulting to any other individuals.
Do not attribute speculation as fact to the names of any individuals, inside or outside of Computer Club.
To remember to respect all members within and outside of this club.
To remain calm and be patient.


If any of these requests are not respected, action may be taken by the Computer Club executive board.
While this situation is being resolved, we must trust kami, Dr. Trenary, and Dr. Carr as they handle the situation.
Many people during the meeting shared their thoughts on this situation. Their thoughts, feelings, and support are greatly valued.

Kalamazoo Makers

ohaimark has told us about a new Kalamazoo Makerspace posted on the Kalamazoo Facebook page.
They are currently looking to start a Python user group.
If you are interested in checking this out, follow this link: https://www.facebook.com/KzooMakers/.

Job Offer

kessler has let us know about a Classroom Technician job offer at Western Michigan University where he works.
Contact kessler on Slack for more information and details.

Linux User Group

fidget has suggested to create a Linux user group to help new Linux users.
With this group, they could meet up every week for about an hour to learn more about Linux or to help others.
To find out more information or to show your interest, contact fidget.

Hackathon

It was mentioned that for an upcoming hackathon, there will be a meeting at Kalamazoo College on Sunday at 3 PM.
They will take a group to talk about strategy and what the event will be like.
An email will be sent to everyone about this. They can reply if they would like to check it out.

Officer Nominations

There will be nominations at next week&rsquo;s meeting for the Computer Club officers for the next year.

It should be noted that kami will be not be running again for president. People should carefully consider who they want the next Computer Club president to be.


The elections will be the week after the nominations.

MHacks

Last weekend, dolphin, kessler, and chibiskuld went to the MHacks event in Ann Arbor. Today at the meeting, dolphin and kessler told us about their experience.

The event lasted 36 hours and they were provided with facilities and places to work. The event was free and is held every semester.
About 500 other people had attended the event.
There was free food and meals for everyone.
They told us it was a fun way to collaborate, take part in workshops (For more info about these, ask kessler, he went to many workshops), and work on other projects.
They advised that everyone should check it out and dolphin offered to drive again if anyone needed to carpool.
They said it was good opportunity to learn, too, as dolphin learned more python.


chibiskuld and one of our new computer club members worked on an android application called MList that lists media. It aims to track shows and movies you watch, books you read, and games you play.

If you would like to help with its continuing development, they will be working on it after the meeting in the Computer Club office every week.



PLAN

PLAN has finally come and it will be starting this weekend.
If you want to help setup tomorrow at 5 PM, meet at the Computer Club office.

People with cars are needed because we have to move many things over to the Parkview campus.


Additionally, strongth, stringy, kami, and sgtsarcasm discussed the prizes to be given at each tournament at the last PLAN meeting.

If you were not there and you are running a tournament, please find out the needed details from kami.


There is also going to be a raffle for people that preregister, so don&rsquo;t forget.

Don&rsquo;t forget to tell your friends, too!

Dynatrace Talk

On March 2nd (two weeks from now) at the meeting, representatives from Dynatrace will be coming to Computer Club to give a free talk.
The topic is currently unknown but it should be an interesting talk for anyone that wants to attend.

Science Olympiad

On February 25th, Computer Club volunteers will be meeting will be at the Bernhard Center for 30 minutes before the Science Olympiad event for registering.
The plan is to meet at 12:30 PM in the Bernhard Center, Room 105.
It would be ideal for volunteers to arrive before 12:30 because registration may take around 10 minutes and set up for the computers will be need to be done before the event starts at 1 PM.
All of the materials are ready, but volunteers will be needed.

In addition to the people that volunteered from last week (kami, stringy, Steve Johnson, hellbacon, pasportit, strongth, and zurek), kell has also volunteered.
It is likely that only between 5 and 6 people will be needed for help.


The event will last an hour long, so people volunteering to be judges should be prepared to be there for the entirety of the event.

Oculus Rift

zurek has 3D printed some mounts to hold the Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch on the wall.

This is to prevent any damage to the headset or the controllers.
It is also preferred to keep the cable off the ground so it is not damaged by being rolled over by chairs.
Please be careful with this technology and use the holders on the wall next to the monitor to preserve the lifespan of the Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch.


Additionally, we are going to buy a third sensor for the Oculus Rift so it can provide more accurate tracking.

This will cost $79 and strongth has informed us that this is affordable in our budget.


We&rsquo;re also buying googly eyes to put on the front of the Rift.

Richard Stallman Talk

The recording of the Richard Stallman talk from January 30th is now available at: https://vimeo.com/kalamazoocollege/review/203166957/41490a2135.
It is a great talk to watch if you want to know more about free software and privacy.

Interview Prep

pasportit and strongth are doing some interview preparation activities tomorrow at noon in the Computer Club office.
This can be a great opportunity to learn more about the skills needed to have a successful job interview for a Computer Science career, so anyone interested is encouraged to come.

Vice President Nominations

We will need a new Vice President of Computer Club for the next two months after nospace has stepped down.
The person to be elected for this position will assist kami in any Computer Club responsibilities and will need to provide assistance with organizing and setting up PLAN for the Spring 2017 semester.
The election will be next week, so everyone has the time between now and next Thursday to consider who they want to vote for.
If you would like to submit an absentee ballot, please contact an officer on IRC.
The following people have been nominated for the position of Vice President:

leech
zurek
dolphin
sgtsarcasm
mobyte

To hopefully get it sooner, strongth will order it from Oculus website directly.

IRC Server

The new IRC server is set up and it is ready to be used.
It is going to be password protected, meaning that LDAP accounts will be tied to your IRC account now.
There are instructions on the Wiki about how to connect to the new server.

You can find this information here: https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu/wiki/WeeChat.


People will be required to move soon because the old and non-secure server will be shut down.
Contact stringy if you have any problems.

This laptop has a good battery and we can use it at events, such as PLAN.
It currently has Ubuntu installed on it.
There is a rule that you can not take it out of the room without permission.
Thanks to kami for buying this!

CTF

This weekend is the first CTF of the semester.
Anyone coming to the CTF class tomorrow must bring a 8 GB flash drive in order to make a Kali Linux bootable USB. Kali Linux requires 3 GB of space, but more space will be preferable in order to take advantage of file persistence.
The CTF this weekend we can work on is Insomni&rsquo;hack.

To find out more information about this CTF, go here: https://ctftime.org/event/382/.
This CTF does not start until Saturday, so we will be having a party at the Computer Club office at Noon.

Spring 2017 Semester

We welcome everyone to the new semester!
Hopefully everyone had a great Winter Break and we are looking forward to everything that will be happening this semester.

IRC

IRC will soon be password protected in order to limit spam or unauthorized IRC usage.

This will eventually take effect, but not immediately in order to allow people to become aware of this change and to update their IRC bots.
It may be about 10 days until we are moved over to this new IRC server.



Scholarship

The President and Vice President of Computer Club will now earn $500 each semester toward their tuition.
This has gone into effect last semester and it will be used for the foreseeable future.
Thanks to flay, sphinx, and Dr. Carr.

The current tentative date for PLAN is April 8th.
The first PLAN meeting will be this Friday at 5 PM in order to start organizing what we need to do.

CTF Class

nospace is now the professor of the CTF class for this semester.
The time is currently listed at 2 PM on the WMU class directory but the time is going to be moved to 3 PM.
The first class will be this Friday in the Computer Club office.
It is a one credit hour class. If you take the CTF class 3 times, it counts as a CS Elective.
You can still sign up until this Friday, but you must send an email to nospace or sphinx as soon as possible.

Python Workshop

Some professors have asked the Computer Club to help with a python workshop for kids.
This could also help us teach about CTFs.

We can then use these credits to buy new books.
If you would like to help us identify the useful books or if you want to purchase any of the old books, let an officer know.


Thanks to ohhaimark for cleaning our Model Ms and for cleaning other tables around the room!

Backup Server

typo is still going to help contribute to purchasing the server, but his contribution may depend on how much the server costs.
hellbacon is still in the process of choosing a server to purchase.

Java Review Session

This Saturday, October 15th at 2 PM, there will be a review session for Dr. Kaminski&rsquo;s CS 1110 class.
This will be teaching Freshmen about while loops, int values, and other Java information.
List of volunteers:

stringy, mind, strongth, nospace, mobyte, wobbles, kami.



PLAN

We need help with getting sponsors.

We are not able to get many sponsors to respond.
If you can give us information about how to get more sponsors, please let us know.


Our goal is to receive money or prizes from sponsors.
Soon we will be going to local places in person to find sponsors.
There is also a Facebook event now available. See it here: https://www.facebook.com/events/154484321677898/.

Send it to all of your friends!



RSO Spotlight

Thanks to strongth being interviewed by Western Herald for their RSO Spotlight!
You can read the article here: http://www.westernherald.com/news/article_b6039980-8f2d-11e6-a573-9b07d24acb7e.html.
There is also a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xB1bnofsto.

Projector

We probably won&rsquo;t be able to use other Kohrman Hall rooms for talks.
Since we can&rsquo;t use another projector, we will have to consider options for getting our own projector for talks.

Router

We may need a new router, since we are currently encountering problems with our current office router.
Details about these issues will be discussed as we determine them.
Possible replacement routers will be considered when we get more information.

Backups

hellbacon is still looking to get a new server for backups. The price range may be between $600 and $700.
Some refurbished servers are also being considered, with one option being around $800.

The specs are 8 cores, 96 GB of RAM, and 10 TB of storage.
Here is a link if you would like more information: http://www.ebay.com/itm/181390661208.
Depending on heat output, we are planning on putting this server in Parkview.
If we cannot put it in Parkview, it will be put in the Computer Club office.


This server will also be used for projects, assignments, or virtual machines for Computer Club members.
Thanks to typo for contributing funds to help us get this new server!

IBM Workshop

strongth has let us know that the IBM Workshop will be during the week of November 7th.
We will have the exact date about five days before the event.

Halloween Party

chibi is hosting a Halloween party on October 22nd.

Java Programming Workshop

Last week we talked about a Java programming workshop for beginner programmers and students from CS1.
This date has been set for Saturday, October 15th at 2 PM.

There will be pizza!
If you want to volunteer, let an officer in the #officers channel on IRC know.



Reminder about Downloading

All Computer Science students have been reminded in a recent email to not engage in any illegal file sharing on campus.
This is a reminder that students should not do illegal downloads on campus or in the Computer Club office.

WIDR

On Monday between noon and 2 PM, sloan will have an interview with tybalt from WIDR to talk about Computer Club as a part of the WIDR RSO Spotlight.
This will give us an opportunity to have free airtime on WIDR radio for advertising.

This may lead to other future opportunities to tell listeners about Computer Club.



Cumin Fundraiser

demorest has brought up the opportunity to have a fundraiser at the Cumin Indian Cuisine restaurant.
The plan is to have many people come in one night and obtain 15% of proceeds.
Here is how it would work:

Coordinate with the restaurant and sign up.
Publicize, get people to go there and spend money.
Computer Club would then get 15% of the money for that night.


The restaurant has a capacity of about 30 people.
Ask demorest on IRC if you want to get more information or if you want to show interest.

Computer Club Talks

nospace is having the first talk of the semester tonight about reversing a binary file after the meeting.
If you would like to sign up for a talk of your own, go to this link and fill out the form: https://goo.gl/forms/oGaElGo3fuDmfBUv1.
It is first-come, first-served, so make sure to sign up as soon as possible.
Reserving a topic and time is not required immediately, but it is important to reserve with your name as soon as possible if you want to give a talk.

IBM Workshop

We successfully have obtained enough interest to get support from IBM to have a workshop at Computer Club!
However, they originally wanted to hold the workshop next Monday.
They are currently working around their schedule, they may be able to set it up this November.
More details will come soon when we hear back from them through strongth.

sphinx

We want to take down signatures to send to the Computer Science department to give sphinx recognition.
This would be a recognition letter to show how much sphinx has helped us.
We will have a signatures sheet soon, ask any of the officers if you want to sign it.

PLAN

The PLAN schedule for tournaments should be on whatistheplan.com soon.
The next PLAN meeting will be next week at some time.

This time is not yet decided
Check IRC in the #plan channel to get more information.


In news about sponsors, Dr. Carr has helped us get donations through the Computer Science department.

This will make it easier for potential sponsors to give us funds.

Auto-Owners IT Internship Opportunity.

A representative may come to club to offer internships.
This will happen on October 10th, RSVP for October 14th.


nospace is planning the First Showcase Saturday for the semester.

It is going to be an obstacle course of about 20 problems.
This should be a good way to learn Java or to get help in Java Computer Science classes.



CTF

One of the first big CTFs of the semester is going to be CSAW CTF this Friday (9/16) at 6:00 PM.
The CTF class ran by sphinx at 2 PM will give a good introduction to CTFs for anyone that wants to know more before CSAW starts.
CSAW CTF is a great CTF for beginners and can be a perfect opportunity to learn more about CTFs.
For people that don&rsquo;t know much about them, a CTF involves finding a digital flag inside a file or using exploits to find a hidden code.

This can be a great opportunity to learn more about software and security.


There will be pizza, so come by and work on some problems and enjoy some pizza!

PLAN

We discussed the potential days to hold PLAN meetings, and we have decided that PLAN meetings will be on Wednesdays at 6:30pm.
At the next PLAN meeting, they will be deciding the tournaments. If you want to give input on the organization and planning for PLAN, make sure to come by.

Oculus Rift

It was offered to buy a program for the Oculus Rift to play more games called Vorpx.
This program could give more access to more games to play.
However, after doing research, we have decided to not invest the $40.

Officer Positions

When cpg stepped down, we needed someone to replace him as VP of OPs.
It has been decided in the past couple weeks that kessler and sloan would take his place as organizers of PLAN.

With two people they may be able to share the weight.
We decided during the meeting to let sloan and kessler be Co-VPs of OPs.
sloan has been focusing on organizing and kessler has been scoping out potential businesses for sponsorship.


Additionally, twitch will be made the webmaster, as he has been working on the PLAN site lately.

Websites for RSOs

nospace went to an RSO meeting today and he learned valuable information about other RSOs.
Many RSOs need new websites and need help from us to get more updated websites.
We are considering ways that Computer Club can create websites in exchange for payments.

Part of the money will go to Computer Club and the rest will go to the person or people that created the website.


To learn more about this, join the #rsosites on IRC.

Video and Audio

We would like to have video and audio equipment for talks and other purposes.
We have received an offer from skuld and have considered asking sink for information about what equipment we should get.
Next week are planning to talk about possible budgets for the kinds of equipment we want to get.

Talks

nospace wants to start up bi-weekly talks, with nospace starting on September 29th.
We have offers from nospace, mobyte, skuld, demorest, and stringy to create talks.
We are also considering having practice talks for anyone that has not given a talk before.
nospace will create a sign-up form for people that want to give their own talks, so make sure to ask nospace if you&rsquo;d like to give a talk.
Before starting, it is suggested to get feedback from nospace to make sure the talk is presentable.

GIC Server

Since GIC is gone, we may be able to use their old server (jazz).
We will have to create a proposal or official document to give to Dr. Carr that will give us access to the server.
There will be more discussion about this in the next couple weeks. To learn more about how we will get the server and how we will use it, check the #officers channel on IRC.

Website Design Offer

Someone named Andrew came by to offer an opportunity to create a website using the Steam API for $800.
It is related to Team Fortress 2 and will use JavaScript and other things related to Web Design.
To learn more about this, email tf2tradingcompany@gmail.com.

IBM

strongth is still looking for sign-ups to show our interest in an IBM workshop.
If it becomes approved, IBM will send someone out and provide some materials for a 2-4 hour workshop.
We will need about 40 sign-ups and we currently have 20.
Let strongth know if you are interested and if you want to sign up.

Parkview Passport

Earlier today, many Computer Club members came to the Parkview to talk to incoming Freshmen about Computer Club.
flay showed up to help out at Parkview Passport by showing off his lockpicking demonstration.
hellbacon, tank, sphinx, nospace, stringy, kessler, kami, and flay all showed up to Parkview to help out. Thanks for all of your help!
We had about 47 people that gave emails to learn more about Computer Club and 2 people signed up for new accounts!
About 7 people signed up with our brand new Computer Club trial system.

This is a 14-Day trial account that lets potential members try out the Computer Club IRC server and gives them a chance to check out the other services offered on our server.
This is available to anyone that wants to learn more about Computer Club, not just Freshmen at Parkview Passport.
This means that we may continue to use this in the future if it ends up being a feature that people like.



PLAN

Thanks to everyone who came to the PLAN meeting last Sunday!

If you still want to help out, let sloan know on IRC.


They have developed a template for contacting sponsors. You can find this template in the topic of the #sponsors channel on IRC.

Some of the things on this template include a checklist of things sponsors should know if they want to help us for PLAN.


We are planning on revising the PLAN tournament schedule, but this is subject to change.
#sponsors is the channel to check out on IRC if you would like to learn more about volunteering for PLAN.

Upcoming Events

Next thursday meeting will be crowded, as it will be the first official meeting of the Fall 2016 semester.

Be sure to include incoming potential members.
Find out more about the new members, talk to them!


There will be minor cleaning in the Computer Club office this weekend, Sunday at 2 PM.

The plan is to clean the floors and tables.


The snake Showcase Saturday is being canceled, we are planning on moving onto something else (potentially a group project).

If you have any ideas for a Showcase Saturday project, let nospace know on IRC.


This 24th at noon, there will be a practice Programming Contest in C208 ran by cpg.

TEKSystems

sloan has got into contact with someone at TEKSystems named Dominic Zanoni.
He says they can provide some prizes for us.
In return, they may want a table to do some networking at PLAN.

PLAN Meeting

This Sunday, August 28 at 5 PM.
The plan is to create a template for contacting potential sponsors via email.
He would also like reach out to people wanting to be on a PLAN Committee that are willing to volunteer at any point during the PLAN preparation or event.
Another thing to do is to discuss which games will be tournaments during PLAN.
Finally, he wants to create a rough draft for a PLAN event schedule so we can let sponsors know what the event will be like.

IRC Changes

A current issue on IRC is that people can create users but we don&rsquo;t know who they are.
Our plans are to change this by requiring an LDAP login to use IRC.

This plan is still being discussed between officers and IRC operators and is subject to potential change.


stringy went over a quick demonstration how to join this new server by using weechat.
IRC bots will also need to send a password to log onto the IRC server if this change is put into effect.

At most, this may only need about two additional lines, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult for IRC bot developers.


There is not an ETA as to when this is going to be deployed, but if it will be put into effect, we will have to plan this at a certain time, so people will not be confused in figuring out how to rejoin IRC.

Events

This Saturday at 2 PM, bring your snake game to Computer Club for Showcase Saturday. See more details here: https://goo.gl/4MVIwq.
There is a CTF created by Facebook that is starting tonight at 10 PM. To see more information about this event, check the #ctf channel on IRC.
Parkview Passport is happening this September 1st from 1 PM to 4:30 PM. If you would like to help out, come to Computer Club around 10 AM or 11 AM.

Dropshock&rsquo;s Projects

Open Lockpicking Community is going to be started back up by Dropshock.

We could get half off lockpicks and lockpicking sets.
If you like lockpicking or you&rsquo;re interested in it, let him know you want to learn more!


Additionally, Dropshock is going to be creating a flight instrument panel to link to Microsoft Flight Simulator.

This project could be finished in a month.
Dropshock planning to make build logs for anyone that is interested.



Oculus Rift

nospace and kessler have found some games that we can use with the Razer Hydra.

We are planning to show these off at the Parkview Passport.
Big thanks to nospace and kessler for putting the time in to find some cool games and for setting up the Razer Hydra!


Sphinx wants to buy &lsquo;The Climb&rsquo; for $49.99

His suggestion is to buy it with Computer Club funds, but we did not come to a consensus as to whether or not we will buy it.



Website Project Offer

Henry Raybern, ceramic construction panel engineer came to our meeting.
He would like us to build a website for him.
See the #officers channel on IRC if you would like to get his contact information.

Weekend Goals

We are going to clean the Computer Club room this weekend.

The plan is to start cleaning this Sunday at 2PM.
We need all the help we can get. If you would like to help out, come by.
There will be pizza and music, so feel free to come help us.


Dr. Carr is inviting Auto Owner&rsquo;s Insurance recruiters looking for Systems Admins and Web Developers.

Security related jobs could possibly be involved.
Check next week&rsquo;s minutes if you are interested.


HTTPS certificate is up and running for the website.

This means it&rsquo;s time to start planning for PLAN.
Since our website is ready, our priority is getting sponsors and making sure everything is going to be ready.
To start it off, we are going to start planning to find sponsors this Saturday at 12 Noon.


At 2 PM on Saturday we are having the Showcase Saturday event.

The challenge is to make a snake game.
Anything is allowed here regardless of quality. Come check it out and show off what you&rsquo;ve been working on!
To get more details about this or to see the rules, go here: https://goo.gl/4MVIwq.


We are going to get a food list ready for bigguy to restock the Computer Club food supply.

If you want to discuss this food list or want specific things, go to #shoppinglist on IRC or tell us in the #officers channel.



Upcoming Events

Passport day is going to be on September 1st.

This is an event we have at Parkview every year to show incoming Freshmen what Computer Club is all about.
Some of our current ideas are to take the 3D printer and Oculus Rift.
stringy had the idea to have a monitor demo facing the hallway so people passing by can see it.
If you have any of your own ideas for things to show off to Freshmen, let us know on IRC.
The time of this event is soon to come. If you would like to volunteer or help out, let any one of the officers know.



Shirts

Our plan is to use our current Computer Club shirt design as our shirt for events, such as CTFs and Parkview Passport.
If you are interested in seeing this design or buying one for yourself, see this link: http://www.redbubble.com/people/chrissphinx/collections/515635-computer-club-crow.
Ideally, we would like to have these shirts ready to use at the Parkview Passport event.

Defcon 2016

tmiley, sphinx, nospace, and stringy are back from Defcon.
Here are some tips they gave to anyone that wants to go to Defcon:

They highly recommended checking out the events and workshops.
A point tmiley made was to check the website in advance and see what things you want to check out.
Pre-registering for the workshops online is essential.
Recommended to not prioritize seeing talks, as you have many chances to see them at a later time.
If staying in the same hotel as the Defcon event, they could stream talks to their room.


They also have brought pictures and videos, which will be shared online soon.

If you want to see those, check the minutes or keep checking on IRC.


Overall, they all had a great time. There was talk about taking a group again next year, so keep it in mind for next year if you want to go!

Oculus Computer

We received the final parts for the Oculus Rift computer.
We will start building it today.
If you want to come check out the completed build and give the Oculus Rift a try, try it out at Computer Club!

PLAN Sponsorship

We need to make sure the sponsorship for League of Legends from Riot is secured.
Additionally, we should see if we can get sponsorship from Valve for Dota 2 and CS:GO.
We should ask WIDR for airtime and/or some sponsorship.
Capcom could also help sponsorship for a Street Fight V tournament.
Some other ideas:

Monster
Red Bull
Bawls


If you want to help with getting sponsorships, let us know. We will be choosing people for the PLAN committee soon.

Parkview Passport

We want to be doing the Parkview Passport event again on September 1st.
This is our chance to recruit some Freshmen and to get our name out there.
Some ideas of things we want to bring to show off are lockpicking sets, the Oculus Rift, and the 3D Printer.
We will need volunteers to help talk to Freshmen about Computer Club.

If you want to help, come to the meetings following up to September 1st to see ways you can get involved.



Showcase Saturday

Showcase Saturday is not happening this Saturday since nospace is at Defcon, but it will be resuming the following week.
The challenge is to program a game in the style of the Snake game.

Oculus Rift Computer

We have received the Case, PSU, and SSD.

Details on when this will be should be on IRC as soon the parts arrive.
The total cost of the PC ended up being $1175.15.

PLAN

We need sponsors as soon as possible.

The pictures from previous PLANs will be a big part in this.
Please let us know if you have any extra pictures from PLAN that you can share.


Anyone who is willing to volunteer with organizing PLAN should talk to nospace.
Additionally, next Wednesday we are having a PLAN meeting at 6PM.

Come by if you are interested in helping us out.

PLAN Preparation

cpg is not going to be the VP of OPs so we will need a group of people to work on plan.
Hardison will help us make a list of things to do that we will need to organize plan.
The group of people that are going to help with plan will need to be able to make important decisions.
People will need to be able to be committed if they want to help.
We will need to organize plan far in advance so we will not need to worry about setting things up shortly before PLAN.
Since Hardison won&rsquo;t be here during PLAN, we will definitely need people to help out.
sponsors should be a priority.

We should have one person dedicated to sponsors.
We should build our relationship with potential sponsors so we can get in contact with them quicker in the future.
We will definitely need help from giggles to get the League of Legends Riot sponsorship.


501(c)(3) is a requirement for many businesses, but instead we may be able to obtain funds by putting them through the University.
Someone will need to rent out the rooms early at Parkview.
bigguy, our VP of finance, will be the person to help us get concessions.

We should focus on getting a wide variety and enough of popular items, since leftover items will go to Computer Club.


Additionally, the webmaster will need to set up the website in advance so people can sign up.
Pre-registration on the website should go up about a month in advance.

Pre-registration gives us general attendance information, tournament interest information, MAC addresses, and tournament team registration.


Posters should also go up early so people know about PLAN.
An Overwatch tournament is expected to bring in a lot more people.
If we need any more information or if we have any questions, we can contact Hardison.
Over the next couple weeks, we will be dividing the needed tasks for PLAN to multiple people.

Oculus Rift Computer

Our temporary machine for playing on the Oculus Rift is gone.
We should buy a new gaming PC if we want to power the Oculus Rift.
mobyte has put a PCPartPicker link in IRC (http://pcpartpicker.com/list/yL8vVY), check it out and give feedback if you want to help us pick out the new computer for Computer Club.

Lockpicking Demo

Jason Johnson is giving a lockpicking demo this Monday at 2PM.
stringy will be there helping to teach high-schoolers about lockpicking.
If anyone wants to help, let stringy know.

Minecraft Server

We&rsquo;re playing Minecraft on a server right now.
If you want to join us, join the #minecraft channel on IRC and join the IP in the topic.

Events

nospace is thinking of shutting down the Showcase Saturday and Coding Challenge Sunday events.
It might be put on hold until the semester starts but nospace is trying to gauge interest.

We won&rsquo;t be able to mount the monitors directly on the wall, since we aren&rsquo;t allowed to put holes in the wall.
Instead we should put them on a stand somewhere around the room.

We need PLAN pictures from anyone that took pictures at the last Spring PLAN.
Please post them somewhere and give us the link on IRC in the #officers or #plan channel.
We are going to be looking for sponsors soon for the next Fall PLAN.
We are going to focus on two groups of sponsors: local and external.
If you would like to help out with getting sponsors for PLAN, contact cpg on IRC.
A deadline is going to be set this Sunday for when we will need PLAN sponsors by, come by if you would like to help.

Showcase Saturday 2: Electric Boogaloo

On Saturday at 2PM we are having another Showcase Saturday.
It&rsquo;s a show-and-tell styled event where you can show off your new coding projects.
There is no minimum effort, you can bring in anything you have been working on lately.
See more details about Showcase Saturday and sign up here: https://goo.gl/llvEHI.

Coding Challenge Sunday

On Sunday from 6PM to 8PM we are doing HackerRank challenges.
These are programming math problems that you will have to solve algorithmically on the whiteboard.
This will help you with whiteboard challenges that you may face in an interview if you want a programming job in the future.
Video games or any other distractions will be banned from the Computer Club room at this time.
See more details about the event here: https://goo.gl/wJbYxk.

Monitors

We got 8 new monitors from pasportit&rsquo;s office.
What do we want to do with them?
An idea we thought up was to create a giant display wall out of all of the monitors.

With this, we could display new announcements in the room.


If you&rsquo;re interested or have any ideas of your own, let us know in the #activities channel.

Orientation

cpg still needs help with Freshman Orientation.
We need people that can talk about Computer Club to new potential members.

Arcade Cabinet

The BeagleBone works.
We need to work on wiring to the arcade cabinet and installing games.

We need help from anyone that can give us advice on wiring for the old arcade cabinet system.
We are struggling to figure it out.
Please let tank or nospace know if you are good with wiring or have experience with the arcade cabinet.


It will run SNES, NES, and GameBoy games.

Projector

We are still thinking about projector possibilities for the office.
nospace is still looking for sponsors to possibly help us out with the cost.
We are also looking for help from anyone that would be willing to help us pay for it.

We were talking about ideas for who we want to be sponsored by. Here are some possibilities:

Logitech
Corsair
Electro-Matic
Razer
Microsoft
Amazon
Asus
Nvidia
Newegg
Tiger Direct
Anything electronic



Room Noise

People will be touring Kohrman Hall on Saturday at some time, possibly around noon.
We will have to keep noise down at this time.

MAME

The parts we need for the MAME have been received. We will be using the BeagleBone.
However, tank may need some help with the programming.
He will be working on it at 2PM on Sunday. Come by the Computer Club room if you want to help.

Projector Ideas

We are looking for a cheap and decent projector. Does anyone know where we can get one?

Some people have suggested looking at the surplus sale.


Our price range is between $100 and $200.
We are going to aim for getting a sponsor that might be able to help us out.
We would like to set up a projector in the room for presentations or other general purposes.

Freshman Orientation

We still need people that would like to help by talking to Freshmen about Computer Club at Orientation.
There are about 10 more sessions left that are available for sign-up.
Please feel free to sign up if you have free time. Here is the link to sign up: http://worf.co/GcJ9a.

MAME

Parts list for the MAME is in the # channel.
Buttercup approves and has ordered the parts for $18.49. The parts should be here quickly since they are directly from Amazon.
Here is the link to the parts list if you would like to look at it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19g1Ns4GCh3SpL-ScpXKZeOpNhCtxahVLpqQRYSGw-Xg/edit?usp=sharing
One part is listed as extra since it is optional, we will wait until after we finish the main build to see if it is necessary.

Orientation

We don&rsquo;t have anything to hand out at Orientation.
Can we think of something to give out for free for this and at Parkview Passport?
Ideas brought up at the meeting: Breadboards, pens, RAM keychain, flash drives, bottle openers, pins.
nospace is going to research to see the pricing on each of these objects.

Society of Plastics Engineers

grizzzly has asked if anyone would be interested in doing a website for Society of Plastics Engineers, ask him for details.

Room Cleaning

nospace is going to be cleaning the Computer Club room at 2PM.
Come by if you would like to help.
However, the building is going to be locked from 5PM Friday to Tuesday, so you will need to contact nospace on IRC or by phone to get in.

Free Computer Parts

whiteout is giving away a lot of free computer parts, contact him if you are interested.

Sign-up sheet in #officers channel if you want to volunteer during any time for the orientation period.

Wireshark Event

nospace is hosting an event with hellbacon at 2PM on Saturday.
It is free for anyone to join.
Links to sign up in #nospace and #geekboy.
If you are not able to come, we may be able to loan out the account to you so you can access it.

Magnetic Strip Reader/Writer

We&rsquo;re buying the $90 magnetic strip reader/writer.
We need to talk to buttercup so we can buy it.

Arcade Cabinet

ohaimark should be able to help us fix the MAME cabinet.
The BeagleBone we have should be able to handle the emulation needs.
We still need the pinouts for the buttons and some extra cords, such as a HDMI to Mini HDMI.
A micro SD is also needed.
Tank will have a parts list soon and post it on IRC.
There is also an idea floating around of making a half-sized one.

API Design

We could have the idea of designing an API for an IRC bot.
cpg and demorest have brought up this idea, we may think of doing this next weekend.

Oculus Rift

We are now considering to get the Nvidia 1070 instead of the 970, so we will wait until that comes out.
The price range should be somewhere between $800 and $1000.
Ohaimark&rsquo;s offer still stands to sell us his computer.
We should consider parts with good warranties, since our machines at Computer Club get a lot of usage.
The machine will need at least 3 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port.

Projects

Nospace has an idea to look at online courses of interest to club.
Nospace would like to get a Computer Club Coursera or UDEMY account.

If you are interested in this, let nospace know.
We can pick out 2 or 3 courses, and then vote on which one to take for a week.


Hellbacon is redesigning the POS to be web based. It is using jQuery and PHP for maintainability.

Some people have suggested using a framework instead of PHP.
LDAP support has also been suggested.
It will possibly also have Paypal support by using their API.
We should also look at AndroidPay support.


We are going to try to do at least one or two hackathons this summer.
Demorest wants to implement ranked voting to stringy&rsquo;s existing voting program.
Ohaimark and tank are in progress of working on the MAME cabinet. They should start work next week. They may need many hardware parts to replace and they will likely make a list for us.
Nospace has brought up his noise detector idea for putting a Raspberry Pi on the wall that can give alerts when the noise in the room is too loud. ADAFruit sells a sound level kit (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microphone-amplifier-breakout/measuring-sound-levels).
Cpg is working on a Google Calendar bot in Go.
We may be starting a new general bot with an emphasis on helping people learn how to create their own bots. Python is the main idea for what we want to use.

We will have a discussion about this in July.



Angular

Angular hackathon is starting tomorrow at 8PM.

Defcon

If you&rsquo;re interested in Defcon 2016, get in contact with flay on IRC.
Estimated cost would be $1000.

Oculus Rift

Our consumer edition Oculus Rift has arrived!
However, none of our computers at the Computer Club can handle its awesomeness.
We&rsquo;re thinking of building a new computer with capable hardware so we can run it.
Based on a cost estimate by mobyte, it may cost somewhere between $700 and $1000.

I will post a parts list on IRC and people can give feedback.


Alternatively, ohhimark is offering to sell us a computer.

Specs are: Intel i5-4690k overlocked at atbout 4.5GHz, Z79 ASRock Motherboard, lots of fans, 8GB DDR3-2133 RAM, 120GB SSD, 850W 80&#43;Bronze PSU, and GTX 780 GPU.
We would probably need to swap out the GPU.


We can compare our final parts list to what ohhimark is offering and see which machine we go with.

Kohrman Swipe Access

We now have swipe access for the Kohrman building.
However, only two people are given access: stringy and nospace.
nospace will be in the computer club office a lot in the summer, so check with him on IRC if you want to get in the room.
In the fall, kami and nospace will be the holders of swipe access.

Summer Project Ideas

Shall we start up hackathons again? Anyone have any ideas for new projects?
hellbacon wants to make a web version of the POS, contact him if you want to help.
ohhaimark is working on an ergonomic mechanical keyboard (Dactyl). Check the wiki for info (https://cclub.cs.wmich.edu/wiki/Dactyl_Keyboard).
nospace has brought up the idea fix the arcade cabinet, ohhimark knows electrical work, so he could help.
Angular is an ongoing project, we could use ideas for what we&rsquo;d like to do

nospace suggested noise detector for room


Do we want to work on another general purpose bot, similar to botler?
If you weren&rsquo;t at the meeting and you have ideas of your own, let us know on IRC.

Spring PLAN Feedback

Lack of sponsors is a con, we need to prepare for sponsorships far in advance.
We should coordinate more events for people to encourage them to stay for longer. A possibility is to prepare a losers bracket tournament in advance.
The format for the LoL tournament is narrowed down well. Should we start the tournament later?
Have some form of communication for people to talk to each other. Discord or IRC are possibilities.
We should get the PLAN website to auto-pull from the github repo.
A dedicated IT person (or two) to help with technical issues, specifically on the network, would be useful.
We should buy gigabit switches to deal with dead port issues and/or get the broken ports to be fixed.

sphinx, cpg, transistor, and hardison volunteer to test all of the ports in D109 in the summer.


The one day format is preferable to the two format. Sunday as clean-up day makes it much easier. Going later into Saturday night is a possibility if people want it.
Better organization for the Smash tournament has been requested by sans.
LoL RSO ran the tournament very well. We should get help from them again, as it helped with the workload. However, the PLAN director should still check in on them.
sans is interested in helping run the Smash tournament.
Dell and Strength in Numbers should come again. We should request better prizes from Dell. We could use a list of expectations from Strength in Numbers.
kami wants to do concessions.
If people don&rsquo;t bring their own ethernet cables, we should sell cables to them.

Use an ethernet tester to make sure they work.



Goals for Next PLAN

Shoot for $2000 in profits.

Getting sponsors and advertising is very important.


Look at what people concessions bought in the Spring 2016 PLAN and focus on those for the Fall 2016 PLAN.
We should focus on advertising on specific subreddits in order to market specific tournaments.
Putting out posters at the right time is key.

Put them up one month before PLAN?


Multiple posters is a possibility. One poster design for each tournament?
We should try to get advertisement at the library.

Date for Next PLAN

The plan is to work around midterms, other events, sports events.
The current possibilities are September 17, October 15, November 5/12/26, and December 3/10/17.
Top candidate is November 5th, with November 12th as a runner up.

PLAN Committee

cpg will appoint a group of people as a PLAN Committee.
PLAN meetings in the future will be smaller and more focused.
The Tournament Coordinator will oversee all tournaments and make sure tournaments are running smoothly and tournaments are starting on time.
The Support Technician will handle networking problems before, during, and after PLAN, as well as being a contact for OIT.
The Assistant PLAN Director will help the VP of OPs with any other additional tasks.
An additional Volunteer Coordinator will help in concessions and event check-in.
The main people running PLAN and running tournaments should not be able to win prizes or play in tournaments.

Notes taken by mobyte
About 10 people present

Stats

About 150 people came on Saturday
Total (raw) profits were approximately $1750.25
97% of these profits were made on Saturday

Snack discussion

Idea was variety, certain things didn&rsquo;t sell as well

Work on optimizing most profitable things


NO GIANT BAG OF POPCORN
Pizza and pop sold well

On Sunday, get a lot less pizza


Mountain dew, coke most popular drinks

Stick to regular monster, don&rsquo;t need special kinds


Skip pop tarts or buy less
Chips/pretzels all in same category, make this more distinct for next PLAN?
Only 3 cookies sold
29 items of candy sold
Get more oatmeal cream pies, really popular
Need better menu and keeping track of items sold

POS System potential? Solves a lot of issues such as inventory tracking


Bottom line, candy and soda are best

Scheduling

Saturday is just more popular, Sunday is still dead
Start on Saturday around noon, make event continuous overnight as long as possible?

Sunday for only cleanup
Move Magic to Friday night?
Longer Saturday and ignore Sunday
97% of profits made on Saturday


Project M not as popular, stick to Melee?
Magic and Hearthstone at separate times, not at the same time.

Put on Saturday



Drugs

Issues with Adderall

No, really


Update to add rule against non-perscribed drugs

Tournaments

Optimize the CS:GO tournament more, finals went on went too long
Riot should only prize to first 5 places

Determining tiebreakers is essential so we can avoid confusion


Structuring tournaments needs to be more decisive
Spectating or streaming by players is not allowed without talking to the tournament director first
Get summoner names from League people, these are important

Prizes

We need prizes sooner in advance so we can advertise them better
Prizes are important as an advertising utility, we should prepare for more people coming to PLAN next semester

Planning next PLAN

Soon we should start planning for Spring PLAN

Plan around the Spring schedule so we do it after midterms
Mid-late march or early April

Possibly late March




Replace TF2 with something else

Start thinking about a different game

Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm?




Keep Rocket League tournament, turned out to be popular
Dota 2 also went well

First Meeting of the 2015-2016 Academic Year!

A welcome to our new members and a welcome back to our old ones!

Door

We do not currently have a door bot, so the most reliable way to tell whether the room is occupied is with the $office command. If your computer&rsquo;s MAC address is registered with fish (one of our bots) and you are in the room, members on IRC will see your nickname following the $office command.
Type $office -r [Your MAC Address] into #geekboy and fish will register your computer.

Office Hours

Officers of Computer Club are required to hold office hours in order to keep the room open for members that need help, or just want a place to hang out.
Office hours can be found on our office hours calendar or our events page. Run $office in #geekboy if you would like to know what officers are in the room at any time.

Communities and Schools

Last year, we sent some volunteers to the Main Street Magnet School for a robotics workshop for students.
Contact sphinx, or send an email to emilydemorest@gmail.com if you are interested in volunteering this year.

One suggestion is &ldquo;positional reports,&rdquo; a space for each officer to talk about what they&rsquo;ve been doing and what they need.

Middle School Robotics

Can we make a simple CTF to hand to middle schoolers?
There is a room at the Kalamazoo Public Library that we could try to use.

Dr. Trenary

Thanks to flay for a great year! We&rsquo;ve come pretty far from room 2244, and we have flay to thank for leading us.

CTF

Link
Friday, May 1 at 11 AM
This CTF has a rating weight of 20, meaning it may be easier and more approachable.
Companies hire penetration testers regularly, and CTFs are great practice.

Jobs

Job listings are found on our wiki.
OIT, the CAE center, and a company called SpareFoot are hiring, plus more! Check the page out.

Hackathons, CTFs, and Workshops

These will be grouped under an event called a Geekout, which could be a CTF, a hackathon, or a workshop.
Look at the wiki page for our ideas.

BountyBucks

Demorest is still making progress!

Tutoring Hours

We would like to start holding tutoring hours lead by members that can tutor in computer-related subjects.
C208 has been used as a tutoring center, but it will not be available from the CS department anymore. This is a perfect opportunity for us to take that over.
If you will have available time for this next semester, please talk to cpg, Hardison, or flay.

Alumni Dinner

An alumni dinner is a possibility in the future.
If you are interested in planning this, or Geekouts, or PLAN, talk to Hardison.

Parkview Passport

Usually the week before classes start.
This is an important recruiting event for Computer Club.
We will need to demonstrate the things that make us the most unique and engage people.
Please consider helping!

Graphics by Kami

Kami has designed some nice graphics for us to use on shirts, business cards, etc.

Shirts
Hoodies
Business Cards
Stickers


The designs aren&rsquo;t finalized yet, but have been generally well received.
Our next move is to create some kind of merchandise section for the website.
Join #officers on IRC to discuss graphics further.
If you have existing graphics that Computer Club has used in the past, please send them to cokezero (cokezero@yakko.cs.wmich.edu).
Note that we are required to call ourselves &ldquo;Computer Club AT Western Michigan University.&rdquo;

Middle School Robotics

Thanks to sphinx, cchao, and camtar for helping out with the Middle School Robotics program!
Talk to demorest or email Emily Demorest (emilydemorest@gmail.com) if you are still interested in helping out with this.
This is an after-school event that involves teaching kids to build things out of Little Bits as well as program.

CTF

Plaid CTF starts tomorrow (Friday, April 17th) at 5 PM and runs at 48 hours.
This is one of the highest rated CTFs that we participate in, so join us!
Join #ctf on IRC for more information.

Yakko Backup

Dan Dyla has suggested backing up yakko to Amazon Glacier.
This is $6 per full 600GB backup, and about $65 for retrieval.
Out of Yakko&rsquo;s full capacity, 652 GB is currently being used.
Currently we do not have a backup system, so please keep your own backups of anything you keep on yakko.

Newsletters

Computer club will soon start sending out professional looking newsletters.
Newsletters can possibly contain articles written by Computer Club members.

cflock

Thanks to giggles for setting up the server ben donated as a VM host (&ldquo;cflock&rdquo;).
It could definitely use RAM, though.

Old Servers

We&rsquo;re selling our old servers that are sitting around in the room.

$7-8 per server. Come by the room to pick one up.



Congrats

To cpg for getting hired with the WSA
And to brandon(stryxpon) for getting hired at UofM

Think of new and better ways to bring up new members so they are always very involved
We&rsquo;re putting out a newsletter to get some publicity for the club.
Demorest: WMU is offering vpn access to have place to play around and hack, maybe getting a subnet set up to play with and break stuff. This would be super cool for the club! We need someone to take the lead on setting it up.
Start building up a database for club contacts old and new

no riot sponsorship, the RSO forgot to contact riot and we don&rsquo;t have the necessary time or teams signed up for sponsorship to allow a riot sponsorship

not a lot of advertisement
This plan will more than likely be smaller, we will need to provide prizes
The idea to push PLAN back was tossed around, but is not really viable

By Renix!
improvements by flay

Meeting begin 6:12pm

###Head Count:

38

###Trenary:

Wants to see us all institutionalize ourselves better
Get better at making a regular processes for the club (Agenda, feeding &amp; caring of younger members, inclusivity)
Have younger members or any memebers jump in and help with projects and events more
Steve Carr is willing to talk about the possibility of officers getting 1 credit hour for being a part in the club per semester.
Think of new and better ways to bring up new members so they are always very involved
We&rsquo;re putting out a newsletter to get some publicity for the club.
Demorest: WMU is offering vpn access to have place to play around and hack, maybe getting a subnet set up to play with and break stuff. This would be super cool for the club! We need someone to take the lead on setting it up.
Start building up a database for club contacts old and new
IRC is for everybody. Argue/Debate constructively.

We&rsquo;re not going to talk about how we&rsquo;re going to store email addresses.
We&rsquo;re going to write the script for now and deal with where to store them later.

PLAN:
Butters sent an email to cotton about a subnet for PLAN

Mame Cabinet:
We&rsquo;ve got it sanded!
Working on it after the meeting.
Staining black?  Might require some careful sanding.
Painting black?  not as pretty.
The cabinet is covered in wood filler so staining would be a bad idea.

MAME: Heat gun is working well stripping paint, but we need to work more often on mame. Drc has made some progress on led buttons for the mame, horray colors! Talk about cool future projects to build into the led, like progress lights, etc.

PLAN tourneys: L4D2, CS:S.
*Talk about a pool of 1v1 games and each person in the bracket would play a different random game. Smaller prize, based on what we get from sponsors. Also will be contingent on MAME status.
*Talk about doing a console game [tournament]. Decided no.
*Check the wave for sponsership status.

We need to start keeping tabs at a more reasonable level.

Idea to create cronjob/something to remind members that their account is expiring soon. Also, we need to collect alternative emails from members. This will be used since many people do not check yakko mail.

Discussion to sell the xraid.&lt;br &gt;
Everyone likes it better than a cclub fileserver. Also, we could use that money to buy a tv and storage! We should probably give PhorceP a cut, that would be fair. &lt;br &gt;
Basically, we have a ton of small stuff to sell on ebay, then build up our raiting. Then, sell the xraid for bank. &lt;br &gt;
Vote to sell with all components: Passed.&lt;br &gt;
&lt;br &gt;
Minutes need to be revamped. We need to edit out profanity and un-necessary slang. These are public, and need to be useful. We need to go back and edit the minutes (old minutes) to preserve our reputation. Drc is to become a supscript of each meeting. &lt;br &gt;

Members present: rancor, zerg, ohnomrbill, butters, grg, cokezero, drc

drc Taking minutes

ohnomrbill has brought in a form for application for an armature radio club license.  We&rsquo;re not sure if we trust ourselves to not break FCC rules (i.e. we are immature rather than armature).  FCC rules don&rsquo;t allow for anything fun (no encryption, etc, what&rsquo;s the point?)

MAME cabinet discussion -  Do we have enough drive space?  Probably, but butters would like more.  We are going to document everything we do to make the system work, and turn it into a script to modify a stock/standard Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) LTS install.  After we get the system built, Zerg would like to get a cap kit for the monitor and repaint the cabinet.  Rancor would like to wait until after Bronco Bash to work on aesthetic changes of the machine.

PLAN - We should probably think about getting in touch with Cotton about VLAN scripts.  What will be brought to Parkview, do we need a truck?  Possibly we&rsquo;ll bring a fridge and some candy.  Not anticipating a large turn out for the Summer PLAN as they generally are not, and we have not been aggressively advertising.

DRC ambles in soon after.

Kyle has shaving problems but also has a fundraiser idea or something
He thinks the club should recycle used/old electronics, jewelry, etc. Ecophone has a program where you print out shipping labels, send stuff in and receive a check.
Includes receipts for tax exemption. We can also order promotional materials from their website. (A recycling pyramid scheme) If people drop off valuable equip. the club can keep it/resell it.
They take ink jet cartridges, cellphones, laptops, cellphone batteries, jewelry?, etc.
The school would possibly give the club money to operate this project (Green Initiative?).
Sounds badass. That&rsquo;d be sweet says Butters.

Let&rsquo;s buy a tv. Okay. Now we need money. Okay.

Summer PLAN: June 19
Advertising on website and a few forums, nothing big. Profit: Sell last PLAN t-shirts, charge for non-members (decision TBA)

Hackinac Island! DRC proposes spending a four day weekend hacking as much of Mackinac Island as possible. Nice.
Seems to be lots of interest among club members. Alternatively, a group could go to HOPE.
Hackinaw and Hackinac domain names available!

Butters passively aggresively tells everyone to stay on topic.

Friendship Village this weekend: Cokezero and Smerky?

Jessie&rsquo;s info on renting a mobile arcade for Bronco Bash. $200/day for rental from KlassicArcade in Gobels, Michigan. Need to check with Bronco Bash organizers to make sure we&rsquo;ll have enough power/Space.
Possibly co-rent the arcade with Red Button. WSA could possibly give us money, especially if two RSO&rsquo;s are involved.

They also have two empty cabinets they would be willing to give us for free. Black one in rough shape but with better specs/Gray one is better shape without all the bling.
Jessie emailed Klassic Arcade and requested the black cabinet and getting a tube. Tubes approx. $80.

Pinballatthezoo.com: April 16th and 17th, $10, play pinball all day

Begin contacting possible sponsors: Greg (Balls!) Kyle (Danger Den)

Nominations for new officers: Rancor and Butters for President and also Vice President. Dylan for VP. Cokezero for Treasurer. Scrabble for Secretary. Kneuts for President (declined).
Think about nominations being done by secret ballot this year. DRC can set up a phonotron voting system. Voting will be April 15th.

Long term goal: Update Constitution

Keys and crap still seem to be a problem ^_^ and its really hot in HERE.

Meeting started: 6:03pm
DRC was already here when the meeting started. So surprising.
Talk about friendship village. 2nd or 3rd week of April, Cokezero and Butters.
Kyle requested censorship of the minutes to protect the identities of certain members activities on St. Patricks Day.
6:04 � Butters calls Whitehat with Google Voice. Mentions that Fonotron is racist and doesn�t like dealing with Japanese numbers.
6:05 � Talk of PLAN profits.  No bill for CClub PLAN shirts yet, talking with Studio to keep updated on information on billing and whatnot.  Cost is ~$260.  Looks like we �basically� broke even on PLAN costs/profit. 
6:07 � Smerky hands out leaking Bawls. Zerg shotguns one of them. Lots of slurping sounds and possibly a stain or two on the floor. Smerky finds the experience �unpleasant�
6:08 � 6:20 � Back to PLAN talk. Thoughts about an �After Action� review on ways to improve for PLAN 14. Earlier advertising.  Butters takes responsibility for failed advertising.  Could use better documentation of efforts planned or completed in case transfer of main PLAN planning duties needs to switch (i.e. Lyth ragequiting) Kyle volunteers to make Nerd-Scout Cookies for next PLAN.
PLAN 14 planned date � September 25th.
Info on BroncoBash will be posted in May, might require shift in PLAN date.
Minimum of two months for initial contact with possible Sponsors.
Keep working list of PLAN sponsors.
July 30th for shirt designs due. 
Smerky complains about frozen Bawls.
Possibly get sponsors to chip in on shirt costs, put their logo on the back.
6:20 � Geekouts? Ideas? Next weekend, not this weekend (2 weeks after PLAN) Start advertising, email Kaminski.  Times? 11am - ?? on Saturday. Activity will be Hack This Site, in CClub Offce
6:22 � UberYakko.  Yakko has uptime of 4 days, 6 days before that, 10 days before that�.. really need UberYakko up.  Getting things up (Butters, DRC, etc..) working on PHP/MySQL/syncing home dirs, waiting on drc�s contributions to finish up initial requirements.  Finish by end of month? (HA!).  Betting started on when Yakko will crash. General consensus of within 1 week.

SENIOR DESIGN IDEA:
Dr.Trenary has a plot to rule the world. Actual idea is for seniors with to integrate their projects with the computer club so that people can do things that they are interested in. Projects would turn in to large scale possibly and possibly long term. This could bring good &ldquo;bang&rdquo; for the computer club. Computer club would act as a client of the seniors who are doing the projects.

We should come up with a really good project so that the CS project will allow it for a senior design project.

Possible software project to interact with class schedules. Other idea is some sort of streaming application.

Distribuated rendering idea for the project. It would be for rendering anything from home. Rendering idea could ideally lead to a tesula cluster.

The new computer is in and it smells real nice.

COMPUTER NAME BRAINSTORMING:
Thunder Pussy
Mavis Beacon
Microsoft Clippy
Olmac
Box
TrapBox
Hal 9000
PornServer

OverMind
BlackBox

BUYING MICE:
Vote passed to buy 5 mice from TigerDirect with $20 rebates. Mice cost $20 each. Alex Bell will reimburse the club if we get jipped out.

Go visit Zergs gallery at Friday, 5-8pm reception in south Korham on the bottom floor.

Meeting starting at 6:23PM.

LDAP:
LDAP NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. Or else we&rsquo;re without email by the end of the semester.
We need to get the email stuff straightened out by the end of the semester. We need to set up an LDAP query by the end of the semester. Groups need to be included also.
Could keep it on Uber or another machine but it needs to get down.

POSSIBLE PURCHASES:
Talking about possibly buying a computer. But it is being held off in case the Bradford system goes into implementation. We also have about $1400. Kyle said that he put together a good machine on newegg for $700. We may hold off on buying it if we need to by gigabyte switches.
If Bradford system is implemented then we may have to do all the wiring for PLAN our selves. The cost figures for cabling would be $70 1000 foot spool of Cat5e and $40 for 200 male connectors.

Drc arrives at 6:38PM.

If you still want to order a shirt you can get $10 to Cameron or pay through paypal.

Friendship Village: No volunteers thus far, Greg&rsquo;s still

Sudo: Some users with sudo were using it to play pranks on other users and so lost their sudo privilege.  As of now there are no sudo guidelines so we will be brainstorming and putting new rules into the constitution.

Potential Sudo Guidelines: 
No unauthorized access without just cause
No pranks what-so-ever, respect other members
All software additions/removals must be made public (possibly creating a separate log file for installs)
No installing potentially harmful software
Sudo access will be granted by President and Vice President
If these guidelines are not followed Sudo will be suspended until the situation is reviewed by President and VP

Balloon project is still active, FYI.

Purchase of a bulb for the projector has been authorized!

Zerg&rsquo;s presentation tomorrow 8:00pm in Dunbar, Studio A (in the basement). It&rsquo;s about motion capture! It&rsquo;s gonna be awesome! Whitehat is gonna wear a skin tight suit! 2009-02-04">

Friendship Village
Saturday January, 14th

Apparently Scarlet isn&rsquo;t actually a freshman anymore due to some sort of &ldquo;credits&rdquo;. You may still call him freshman but he would appreciate air quotes when using the term. This is entirely optional, however.

Presentations:
January 22nd- VIM presented by Steffo
January 29th- Phishing presented by Whitehat
February 5th- Motion Capture presented by Zerf
February 12th- Intellectual Property Law presented by DRC
February 19th- TCP/IP presented by Lazer
February 26th- Something by Cowbar
March 19th- Soft RAID presented by Cameron

PLAN- Tentatively March, 28
Team Fortress II
Guitar Hero
Smash Bros. Brawl
Left 4 Dead
Everyone loves the idea of a &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; PLAN (Retro-PLAN, Ye Olde PLAN)

Wass is okay.

Cleaning party this Saturday. There will be PIZZA. It will be around  If you don&rsquo;t come, you don&rsquo;t get to keep your club key. We&rsquo;re still looking into alternatives to this key problem. Getting a doorknob with key pad is a possible option. Building services are probably the people to talk to.

C-Club getting in on an open source project, or starting up one of our own. Such as, a blackboard application.

Welcome back!

The building coordinator will not give us any more keys. Jesse suggests we get a key safe to put on the door so every club member has access. Club is unofficially allocating $20 to this project.
Cameron is looking into getting a list of names who keys have been signed out to so we can track them down (there are over 12 out there!)

Greg&rsquo;s Analogy: Would you go to a friends house and, not understanding how a microwave works, stick a bunch of metal in it and run it for a couple hours? Well, don&rsquo;t do that thing to our server!
Translation: Don&rsquo;t fork bomb the server on accident.

Office Cleaning
This must be done or we may lose our room! We should schedule a monthly cleaning date.

Presentations Finalized! Jen refuses to make another list of possible presentation topics because she is forced to do this every week. Please see previous minutes.
Smidget-Jan. 7th

Greg makes a chart: Who is not available on what days
Mon-0
Tue-10
Wed-4
Thur-10
Fri- No one wants to come
Splitting up meetings and presentations? 
bad idea- presentations would get no turn out, they&rsquo;d be forgotten about
good idea- drink specials at Bilbo&rsquo;s

Presentations are tentatively going to be scheduled on Thursdays at 8:00pm.  This avoids conflicts with professors we want to come who have classes, etc. 
Next presentation is Steffo&rsquo;s VIM presentation on Jan. 22nd.
February 5th is Photoshop or motion capture presented by Zerg

PLAN
We made $388! More than usual, despite having a lower turn out. People who won tournaments will be able to come for free next PLAN.
IDEA: Have a new (easier) tournament next time to encourage less hard-core gamers to enter or have a designated noob tournament
We definitely need more sponsors next time since we had no prizes! 

Access points need to get up this week.

Uber-Yakko was supposed to be up by Thanksgiving! What&rsquo;s the deal? It&rsquo;s not yet mounted properly

If anyone knows where &ldquo;this&rdquo; power supply goes, let Cameron know.

Friendship Village is this weekend. Meeting at C-club at 12:00 and driving over by 1:00. Dora, Greg and Smerky are going, anyone else is welcome to join.

DRC arrives 6:21

CLEAN UP THE CLUB OFFICE YOU SLACKERS
ALSO, take anything you may be working on that you don&rsquo;t want messed with, moved, or accidently thrown out. The office will be cleaned over break.

Tabs need to be paid before break. The limit for tabs is $5. Don&rsquo;t go over! Cameron will come get you.

DRC brought in an example of his TV-begone project kit if anyone wants to check it out. Tis super cool. Projects are costing $15 now, but the club is subsidizing the kits down $10. The proceeds will go to creating more project kits. DRC made TV-begone and a programmer kits, he is super awesome. Kyle loves him, but don&rsquo;t we all.

Whitehat is gonna pick up some more wire strippers for the club. 

Conference Idea
Host a weekend conference sometime on a couple specific topics. We could re-present previous presentations, host a couple workshops, get Trenary to come talk and maybe host a guest speaker. Sometime in March or April possibly. Conference ideas: COMPUTERS

Presentation Ideas Next Semester
Smidget will be presenting early January (on something)
Cameron: RAID presentation
DRC: Software laws (and conspiracy theories, I suspect)
Whitehat: Social engineering
Whitehat&rsquo;s brother: Digital security or (he&rsquo;s studying at Ferris to join the FBI)
Mr. Macky the linear algebra teacher would like to present
Dr. Al Fuqaha: something
Lazer: TCP-IP
Cowbar: dunno yet
Shubot: history of computers

Private WOW server is awesome and free. ccowmu.org/wow to get hooked up! Only people allowed on server are people within two degrees of separation from computer club members. Jen is the highest level on the server who got there legitimately, booya. How to regulate cheating and stimulate economy with so few players has yet to be determined. Removing the level cap would be fantastic. Spacey&rsquo;s idea: make an instance based on the average group level.

Friendship Village
Last Saturday, 11/15, went well. Next date to go is December 5th. You can still sign up to go and help out the old people.

T-Shirts
Shirts have not been ordered yet. Stu will be ordering them ASAP.

Are the access points on-line? We&rsquo;re keeping three and selling the rest individually. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll be sold for $100&#43;.

Lazer spilled two cans of pop on the floor. Now we have to get the carpet cleaned, thanks Lazer.

Whitehat&rsquo;s fundraiser idea: sell blood and semen (A.K.A. Hacking Darwinism) 
Any real fundraiser ideas? Prostitution, selling donuts, selling ethernet cables

MAME Cabinet update
We need money!
Lazer found a 27` for $300

Clean your crap off the work bench please! We need the room.

Moving computer club meetings to a different day next semester:
Discrete structures is Thur. night so many members would have to miss the meetings.  Possibly moving to Thursday at 5:30 (but would still conflict with presentations) or moving it to Wednesday or Friday night.
Tentatively, computer club meetings will be Wednesday at 6:00pm. 

PLAN is THIS SATURDAY
Cokezero and 
Free admission for people who are volunteering at PLAN and half off for CClub members
$15 get you into the PLAN and membership in club

Whitehat&rsquo;s virus presentation is tonight.
Smidget wants to do one when he&rsquo;s in town at the beginning of January.

        <article class="minute-list-item" data-year="2008" data-search-content="Meeting Minutes - November 13, 2008 Meeting called to order: 6:14:00pm

Drc arrives: 6:15:30pm what a late bastard

Spacey is writing minutes in place of the slacker secretary Jen

Studio - Do we need someone to be an official secretary, or can we just force it upon unsuspecting noobs on a meeting by meeting basis?

Response - Well, unless we want to rewrite our constitution&hellip; and we are kind of lazy, so no.

Second order of business: FRIENDSHIP VILLAGE

Jen arrives: 6:17:30pm. I guess being married to the president conveys a slack sense of duty

We went to friendship village this past saturday for the intro trip, and we will need people for this saturday for another orientation.  Whitehat will go again, so will Grg, Dora will not be able to since she is going to kill bambi.  We can always use more people.  Like last time, we will meet at the CClub office beforehand.

Third order of Business: PLAN X

Sponsorship: edgetechcorp.com might sponsor the cclub in general, but we are attempting to convince them to sponsor Plan X in addition.  As payment we will put a link on our website for their site.  We will get a discount on our purchases from them - more details will be coming soon. Do we want to ask them for a set percentage off?  Thinking at least 25% off.

Kyle will be printing up flyers for the Plan X tomorrow. We should also chalk up the campus in addition, even though it is supposed to rain.

Next order of business: Presentations

Whitehat&rsquo;s presentation!  Computer Virus!

Crowbar is talking about something, but he&rsquo;s quiet and no one is listening.

Jade can possibly do one also.

We need more presentation ideas for the upcoming semester.

Next order of business: Project Kits

Need to clear off the work bench - in part, Move Uber Yakko!
Drc is talking of project kits, no idea what though.  Something about TV Be Gone Kit ($15)

Next order of Business: Uber Yakko Migration

Crowbar - U-Yakko done by Thanksgiving.  Will replace Dot and Yakko (dot - irc, voip, opendpn server)  Web server on yakko again? If so, we are retarded.  Sys logs being sent to Ed&rsquo;s machine.  Rita is also going bad - possibly turning into a Syslog server.

Subtopic: trimming down the access to sudo.  Will also force better passwords for all yakko accounts.  Ideas for sudo trimming: Keep it the way it is, pare it down to only officers/sysadmins, a Tiered system (sudo to some things, but not others depending on role)

Crowbar went back to his corner and keeps trying to talk about important things that we can&rsquo;t hear.

Nxt Order of Business: Fund Raisers

Kyle&rsquo;s idea is wondering if anyone else has ideas. So useful.

Mel&rsquo;s Idea is a Bake Sale (cookies, cookies, etc)
Cost: $3 per 2 batches.  Selling cookies for major profit (1000% profit margin. Even the underwear gnomes didn&rsquo;t have it this good)

Added idea: Also sell hot chocolate / coffee at this bake sale

Next Order of Business: Tie back to old order of business - Rita. Crowbar needs to learn how to project his voice.

Next Order of Business: Solicit some local guy for a presentation about games, cause we all love games.

These orders of business are getting short - we must want to leave

Runt died, Crowbar babbled, no one listened.  Something about replacing Runt with Old Yakko when it&rsquo;s pulled from Parkview

We need a geekout - possibly this weekend after Friendship Village.  Ideas?

tim swapped out the 120gig for a 200gig. the 200gig is missing, an investigation is to follow. Now that he has split town, we suspect moving to new hampshire was a ruse to run off with a 200gig harddrive.

Presiding: Dan
Recording: Tim

Meeting began at 6:09 PM


presentations

Sean&rsquo;s presentation is today.  Suggestions have been solicited.  Greg suggests pairing people for presentations.  DrC might do the BASH presentation if we ask him.  Dan suggested a Saturday meeting, possibly for a geekout.  Cameron offered to cover regex.  Trenary offered to do a presentation. 

We need to improve our advertisement.  Tim suggested that we do a series on security.  We could even possibly get the WSA to bring Jay Ball to campus to talk, since he&rsquo;s a professional white hat.  

Cameron would be able to do his on SSH and regex next week.  Ben We. suggested a presentation oriented to SSH, SSL/TLS.  We would like to get Jim Cotton to do a presentation.  

Schedule is as follows:

Cameron - 11/1 - SSH/Regex
DrC - 11/8 - BASH
Sean - 11/15 - Cross-site scripting
Trenary - 11/29 - whatever
Dan - 12/6 - Parallel programming

PLAN

Cameron reported on his tasks.  

Discussion was taken on who would provide the pizza.  Rashad suggested that we
talk to some businesses that would offer free food, such as Pancheros.  Someone pointed out the danger of lots of burritos and geeks in enclosed spaces.

Dan complained about the Herald&rsquo;s advertisement of our presentations.  Dan gets off topic.

Preregistration was discussed.  We had at least 90 pre-registered.  

Advertising was discussed.  We need to modify the fliers, since we forgot the cost on the fliers.  Rashad will redesign the fliers to include the cost tomorrow.  The cost was discussed.  Suggestions include $15.  

Eric arrived.  Eric announces that we have more prizes and fewer people attending.  

Warsow tournament $160 soundcard (1st), $100 sound card (2nd), headset, backpacks, beanies.  
Greg suggested double elimination to give away the headset.

Cameron suggests that we have a separate price for non-tournament players.  Eric indicated that there could be problems in verifying people&rsquo;s membership in tournaments.  Cameron agreed with Eric.

Cameron is talking about how to survey attendees&rsquo; opinions about the PLAN.

Cameron complained about two errant members who were misbehaving.  Ben asked Cameron about Sentinel.  Cameron reports that Sentinel now has it&rsquo;s 3 gigabit NIC cards.  Sentinel will be up next week for testing.

Dan asked for a PLAN committee meeting.

Greg indicated that we could setup a VLAN with the Univ of Ill at Chicago so that we could play games with students at UIC.  

A vote was taken on $15 as the cost.  Yes-9, no-2

Members of the PLAN committee will meet on Friday at 2:00 at the CCLUB office.

Greg wants to do some Facebook ads.  The cost would be $30-50 for one week.  Tim advised that we get preapproval for the ads.  The question is for a max of $50.  The vote was affirmative and unanimous.

Treasurer&rsquo;s report

Cameron believes that we have $800 in savings and $300 in the checking account.

Sudo access

The sysadmin group will discuss developing set guidelines on how to govern who gets SUDO capability as a committee.

Dan Gore is the President?  Mr. Gore inquires if the minute taker is ready to take minutes.  The minute taker confirms his preparedness.  For some reason it is really warm in the club office and Mr. Rancor has disappeared.  That guy!  Lately Mr. Rancor has disappeared from CCLUB meetings. It seems like there is no reason to consider carrying on this conversation, but it is not really a conversations because it is one sided.  So please refrain from posting lude comments on the forum below.  Thank you tmiley.  Gregerg shows up contemplating recompiling his source code slash kernel of Linux.  

Dan Gore is getting antsy about starting the meeting.  We should probably have more PRESENTATIONS.  Dan attempts to write an   so people could submit their ideas, but he suggests that we just utilize email for such communication.  Whitehat chimes in with how lame his presentation is going to be, but for some reason nobody seems to care since his marriage is really stressing him out.  I&rsquo;m sure most men can relate to the utter haste it causes for most of society.  There was a saddened hush that fell over the less than usual Computer Club attendees as Whitehat failed to mention the legality of &ldquo;Sequel Injection,&rdquo; or better called &ldquo;SQL Injection.&rdquo;  (es queue el) Squirrel, or Sequel.  Rancor attempts to clear his tab for the Computer Club drawer.  Yes! We have a cash drawer and we use it.  Come stop by and purchase some goodies for yourself.  Give a mouse a cookie, he asks for a glass of milk.  Dr. Claw owes the drawer one dollar and fifty sense, I mean cents.  

Carlos (C4) is supposed to be doing a presentation on Locksport later on.  

We should talk &lsquo;bout subnettin&rsquo;! Rancor appears grumpy as the magical butterfly flutters in his hair. Who had Jimmy Johns this weekend and left their crap in the club?  We&rsquo;re going to fingerprint everyone unless Greg confesses.  We did receive a new fire extinguisher for our room.  Good thing, in case there is a fire, but Tmiley removed it.  Hopefully we never need a fire extinguisher because we do not have one.  Would someone like to get us a fire extinguisher.  More complimenting on funny XKCD and funneh pics on the internet.  Thank you.  

The PLAN8 LAN PARTY is coming soon.  It should be pretty fun.  WMU Homecoming is this weekend and everyone should go and enjoy themselves.  WMU has a new AD Campaign, it&rsquo;s quite funny.  We&rsquo;re still better than CMU in every way.  (CMU Students, you may email us and we will prove your complaint.)

Jim Cotton should precipitate his knowledge to the world and Whitehat is a snoop.  I hope his wife never causes him to look over her shoulder, because he will probably complain.  I like her a lot.  Thanks babe.  

Mstaff brought the computer club a VGA cable.  What a nice guy.  Hey My Frien&rsquo;!  Would ANYONE LIKE TO DO A PRESENTATION ON PHP!?  BASH = DRC.  Sea Four considers &ldquo;winging&rdquo; his presentation and wishes for a &ldquo;white thing&rdquo; to be there.  Is someone going to advertise the presentations?  We have a director of PR.  In a world of SPAM, the computer club would like to participate, but we would like to not be spammed anymore.  So stop it you Montagues.

We would like to become DEFCON miniatures.  Firewire is so much better than USB.  www.apple.com ==&gt; PLEASE SPONSOR US.  As Cameron considers speaking, the misses enters the room and hinders that idea. Laughter fills the room as he considers running away.  

Dell is threatening to sponsor us.  Note to Apple Inc.: We wouldn&rsquo;t mind an academic sponsorship, nor would we mind testing any of the equipment/ideas/etc. that you would like to invest in.  Cisco is way better in networking than IPTaBLES or anything linkux.  Greg complains about talking about important stuff.  Then we realize we are the computer club.

Red Octane would like to contribute?  That would be fun.  Contact us.  Someone is donating servers?  Rancor is not using his XP box or something because he cannot overclock his USB ports anymore than they already are.  Whitehat sits silently waiting for a nudge from his wife to go mow the lawn.  

We need help &ldquo;Flyering.&rdquo; We need help advertising and /etc/init.d.  Someone suggests calling up the PR director. I would like to eat some Pizza and some Pumpkin Ale.

The projector is flaking out, probably because of the Cat5 or something.  

Stuff we&rsquo;re getting rid of can go to Surplus.  

Nobody emailed the potential new members that signed up at Bronco Bash.  Whitehat suggested that he himself does it.

Bronco Bash
September 7th!

Our booth has moved&hellip; :( 
Behind Everett Tower 

Side conversation about daisy chaining power strips and battery backups.  

Are we going to do the balloon?  Probably too late to do that now.  Still considering Oberon cantenna.  

Bring extension cords. 
Bring VoIP pay phone.  
Phreaking Simon contest&hellip;

We should probably do a contest for girls that will have to come back later at night.  

Certifications 
Net&#43;
CCNA
CISCO Lab
wifi hacking demo lab. WEP 

Bring receiver and speakers.  
RUNT
Ben said he might bring some speakers or something and then when Cameron asked a question Ben goes: &ldquo;Hold on, I&rsquo;m doing something important!&rdquo; as he gets pwnt by Bowser.  

Windows is talking about hacking his apartment&hellip; newb. 

Perhaps being next to the chess club will augment our image.  

CCLub needs more Apples.  

Cotton should come to our club or give a presentation.  

Presentations: There is a presentations page.  

We should probably have a webadmin&hellip; or a lead web designer.  c4&hellip; 
amp
First week of school we need to do in the first 8 weeks and send an abstract to Dan Gore.  

Dan would like to present about open source and some wants to go first.  He is whining.

Meeting Started: 18:30PM

We have our LumenLab eVo Projector set up and pointed at the projection screen.  Greg fixed the projection screen with his mad hat leet skills.  Good job greg!

CClub just got back from DEFCON15! It taught us a lot of stuff.  There are pictures at http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/defcon

We like the idea of Hacker Jeopardy. We should do something like this for a fund raiser.  

Network visualization for PLAN?  Wall of sheep!  Demonstration of hamsterizing and other such fun stuff.  

Greg&rsquo;s wii is on the projector.  Greg is not paying attention to the meeting&hellip; tsk tsk.  Not bad looking on the projector.  Now mstaff is not paying attention to Cameron rambling.  Holy crap the weather thing on the wii looks cool. Crazy legs dan is on - full screen.    

There is an Apple PowerMac G4 Graphite thanks to tmiley.  Probably the best computer in the building next to Dan&rsquo;s MacBook Pro.  

PLAN8 and something&hellip;. shoot.  

Whitehat&ndash; 

Balloon - 1000ft.  Might be a good idea to get this ready for the Bronco Bash.  mstaff and c4 need to get together and put some stuff together to really do some stuff. Parachute cord or something else instead of fishing line.   Drc makes DC motor whine.  We&rsquo;re getting a wench and making her do it.   

Saturday - Geekout - Guess what&rsquo;s on the schedule&mdash; cleaning&hellip; Geeks = Messy

Cameron is hungry.  

Becoming a member of TOOOL.US - we have to make small meetings and take minutes then we might be accepted as a chapter.

It was a lonely summer afternoon as the Computer Cub of WMU began their meeting.  It was today, June 28th, at 6:32 PM that we began seemingly on time.  Albeit Dan, our president was late, extremely late and Tim was nowhere to be found.  Only a feat that drc usually tackles with the naked eye - aligning bits perpendicularly.  Dan enters the glory filled room with a smirk on his face.  The air conditioner is finally fixed and bellowing sweet cold air, finally our data center can resume at optimum conditions.  

PLANB - Waiting on Dr. Greeeeen

Need advertising for PLANB - RANCOR!
Tournament?  What games? PC games.  Counter Strike.  Starcraft, warcraft&hellip; Quake3, just for fun.  Dan suggests that we should not do a serious competition until fall.  

5$ - Free Parking

Sign in and name tags - punch ticket.  Hole punch the name tag.  

Where are the GigE cards?  

OFFICERS MEETING: Saturday 3:00PM 
Need directions.  

VoIP - Get 800 Number.  Asterisk&hellip; waiting on ports&hellip; voicemail - sent to email&hellip; drc should set up 800 number with his ping application.  One company for incoming, one company for outgoing.  

VPN is working. 

DRC SHOWS UP! OpenVPN - Tun/Tap interfaces.  

ParkView
Rita
Yakko

Wiki documentation! Hooray.  drc&#43;&#43; tmiley&#43;-

UDP53 &hellip; nstx&hellip; hehe&hellip;

yakko.cs.wmich.edu

We need some IPs and our own DNS.  

Backing up yakko&hellip; Probably should do something about it.  Once VPN is set up, use kerberos or LDAP to authenticate all computers&hellip; 

Personal backup space, mapped drives.  Storage space.  Hardware vs software RAID&hellip; 

The sysadmin lightens the party with mischief&hellip; 
Here&rsquo;s your ips.  cclub1 and cclub2.  
.77
.78
.203
.204

Humor
&ldquo;Hot Dogs&rdquo;

Treasurer will keep track of usage and bills.  Documentation should be well done.  

LDAP vs pushing files&hellip; drc&ndash;

Cameron is allocating funds to drc for VoIP and it is approved.  Looking for credit card or something.

allocating $48.63 to Cameron for reimbursement for the party. 

Dan donated a whiteboard, thank you Dan.
Greg is also going to donate one, thanks Greg.

Horton offered to find a low end router for us, thank you Horton.

Plan B:
Date: ?  Some time in summer 2  

Schedule for presentations, geekouts.
Greg is building a projector, should we move the screen? People seem to like that idea. Ed is scared to look above the ceiling. This would be a cool geekout project.

Bronco Bash:
We still have our tent, need a location near a building so we can plug our stuff in. We should probably figure out where it&rsquo;s going to be. Construction will probably mean it&rsquo;ll be in the same place as last year. We need some new stuff to show off, like T-shirts. Dan says Bronco Bash would be a good way to pimp tech week.

Tech Week: 
Tim suggests one major speaker. We need to find a way to appeal to the public. Tim volunteered to take charge of the whole deal. Dan suggested trying to hook people with presentations.

The office needs to be cleaned again, despite the fantastic job drc did last time.

Rebuilding library. some of the books are old, but not old enough to be humorous. should we get new books? not sendmail, that would break our shelf.

Dan wants us to have club toys, like a wii. 
Asterisk account would be cool, we&rsquo;ll actually try to get that done asap.
We want to be better buddies with the CS department, apparently they like us too. It was mentioned that almost all of C208&rsquo;s staff are our agents. We could recruit new agents out of C208

We need an officer meeting to schedule and organize stuff. Tenatively scheduled for 6/09

The black box
What do we do with that thing?  What is it&rsquo;s status? It has an OS, but nothing configured.  We are going to use it as a communications device, with VPN, the Asterisk server, and the IRC server.  

Rita is currently registered with OIT, so we can&rsquo;t yet re-register it until it gets deleted at the end of the semester.

A discussion ensued about how DNS worked and how to get Rita registered.

Also discussed was the firewall configuration and why we don&rsquo;t have yakko in the office anymore.  Tim suggested that we move the black box over to the machine room and configure it from there.

Eric proposed that we do a barbecue, using the left over burgers, fries and hot dogs from a previous PLAN.  Cameron offered his house in Battle Creek for a barbecue.  

Cameron suggested the weekend after finals, but a few people objected due to moving.  We are looking at Friday on finals week.

Telephone issues

DrC wants to to retire the WAXYFAT number for the CCLUB.  DrC tells us that he knows of a company that can provide an 800 number for $2.50/month and $25 setup fee.  $0.02/minute incoming/outgoing.  A local number is $5/month and 1/2 cent/minute for incoming/outgoing.  This is through Nufone.  We would also have unlimited incoming channels.

DrC proposed that we vote on getting a telephone number for the CCLUB.  We can choose a vanity number for $25.

We will put the action in for review pending consideration of our finances.  DrC suggested that we can do a prepaid scheme.  Motion tabled until the next meeting.

The CCLUB has a wiki
Dan set it up at http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/wiki.

Present: Tim, Carl, Eric, Craig, Dan, Joe, Sean, Brian (taking minutes)

Began: 6:12pm

Office arrangements - The office has been arranged well for selling concessions again. We have office hours covered pretty well but we could use more people, especially in the morning shift of 8am-10am. Imagine, if you will, weary-eyed students attending their 8am classes&hellip; what better way to wake them up than an ice-cold Bawls. There is some concern that the shelf for food is not stable but we&rsquo;ll throw around ideas in the future about how to secure it.

WSA rep - 2nd call for a WSA rep (no volunteers last week). WSA meetings are 4:15-5:45pm on Wednesdays and are important to attend if we want to get funding for certain events in the future. Sean has volunteered to take up this task.

Treasurer&rsquo;s report - Miles not present, no treasurers report.

LAN party - 6 people indicate a willingness to help. We&rsquo;ll shoot for Saturday, November 11th 12pm-4am provided that everyone stays interested.

Executive Director - Brian
Sponsors - Brian
Concessions - Craig
Tournament Master - Eric
Auxilary Network Engineer - Joe
Advertising - Dan

VoIP phone - Members seemed generally enthusiastic about having a computer club extension. The extension could be set up to simply record to their voicemail box or forward to their actual phone. Special extensions would be set up for officers currently holding positions.

Geekout - Geekouts have become a more official event and are now listed on our website. To help pay for materials, we discussed the idea of charging $5 for attendees. There were 4 votes for the movement and 3 against so we will hold off untel we can discuss this more.

Concessions for the office - Bawls were purchased from Imperial Beverage in Kalamazoo. We bought 5 cases with 24 cans (16 oz) per case. Members will go shopping tomorrow or Saturday for new candy and other drinks for the club office. We are running dangerously low on several items and are completely out of the essentials&hellip; like Skittles. Craig will provide the Sam&rsquo;s Club membership. We did not set a budget but Tim will go with to keep things within limits.

Seating - We want to buy a couch (or even two) for the club office. A brief look on craigslist lists 2 decent-looking couches at $50 a piece and another at $125. We voted and all members were in favor of a $150 limit to purchase seating this weekend.

7 members attending, Joe W., Velex, Tim M., Craig, Isaac, Chris H. and Brian.
Someone needs to get the cards for changing the name on the account.  The current secretary
is suppose to get this and then have all sing it including the tresurer.
In order to do this we need copies of everyones ID&rsquo;s and SS numbers.
Brian has the checks from the Computer Science Department.  We need to get those cashed
or destroyed.
We need a tresurer who can actively go through the checks and get them cashed.
The old office was suppose to be used by the art department.  The stuff that was in that office
is now in our office.  This was accomplished last saturday.
Appearntly the old office is still going to remain unused.  Tim M. is now working in the room
that is right next to the old office. Isaac and Joe G. both should have keys to the old office.
wtf bbq.

Summer PLAN
We are thinking of keeing it simple and sell minor things.
The next one might be a basic PLAN for free instead of a larger PLAN.
We&rsquo;re not going to aim at advertising.
This one will be based on just networking and having fun.
Discussion involving transfering the responsibilities of the LAN were in order.  Tim M. ask who would be willing to take on the responsibilities.
We will need to talk to Jim C. About the VLAN for implementing it on the day of the LAN.
We are thinking June 10th, 10am to 12am, this is the ideal time we want to do the PLAN.
There is also 24th and 25th for dates.
July 1st is also a tentative date for the PLAN.

Final decision: PLAN B will be on July 1st, Brian F will e-mail the Dean.

Expenditures
We are thinking of purchasing a filter for the faucet in the Kitchen.
Voted stated 4 to 0, 3 not voting.
We will purchace a new filter for the office.

Michigan Message Center is looking to possibly donate their old machines, We are willing to gladly accept them.

We have finalized the rest of the Presentation schedule.  Joe W. will have a presentation next week on Open GL.  Two week following thanksgiving we will be having a presentation on Open Questionaire.

We still owe Joe G. Money for the phone bill, and Craig money for the Bawls.
PLAN 5:
Brian is thinking of having a one day LAN 12PM-4AM
tacos.
more tacos.
Needless rambling, idividuals are going on about their classes.
Yakko has been updated. (updated hard ware, etc.)
Joe W. Wants the firewall swapped already so we can get a VPN to the office up.
The computer club office now has 2 machines. One machine is a NAT firewall, the other machine is designated for more pratical uses.
The NAT has dual displays and processors.  The pratical machine contains a Geforece 4MX 420, and has a sound card routed into an old stereo with house speakers on shelves.
This was done to promote use of the office, and make the office a more comfortable environment for office hours.
Soon we&rsquo;d like to NAT the office to YAKKO so we can have share mounted remotely using NFS.

New user creation script needed
We need a script that will do the following, not necessarily needed over the web.
It needs to do the following:
-create user
-Set the home directory
&ndash;date = /home/(sum, fal, win)(year)/(name)
-expiration
-password
-home dir/web dir owner ship/chmod.
-group
-automatic blog creator? see below.
-mail the &rsquo;new-user&rsquo; e-mail to the users supplied e-mail address (Not yakko).

Joe G. is creating a website &ldquo;Planet Yakko&rdquo; for individuals who don&rsquo;t already have WebBlogs.
His invision is to have blog applications for all of the users.
The planet site should &lsquo;aggregate&rsquo; the blogs to create a central site for blogs.
Brian has schedules for the tournaments for the PLAN.
This can be found hopefully on www.whatistheplan.com

Widr was down yesterday, because Joe W. Turned the master volume up.  There is no understanding of why this has happened, however if left the way it is now, noone should have need to touch it. Phorce P managed to repair it.

Joe W. wants to know what kind of local sponsorship we should have.
Supposedly bust buy.
It appears no students showed for the meeting tonight, looks like we are calling it a night.
we hope the times will be the same, or longer, since the night time is more appealling to individuals.
hoping for:
9-1 sat. 8-12 sun.

9 members present: Eric, Matt R., Melissa, Velex, Brian, Miles, Tim, Joe W., Chris
Start time: 7:14PM 
1) PLAN A:
Brian is having issues with Bawls as a sponsorship,
Brian is currently awaiting an email to explain the situation.
Brian tried for sponsorship and they accepted, however had the incorrect date.  He asked for this to be corrected and the sponsorship was removed.  He went to reapply and was declined.
The other sponsors have not returned our call.  Our next order of business is
advertising.  We still need to get the port numbers for the other room.  Should
we reserve the room to check all of the ports and make sure that the ports are
in the script. However gamerz stuff is sending a mouse pad.
Brian needs to receive the new port numbers from Jim Cotton.
Brian wishes to go out a night early to check the ports. If this happens they will need to have Jim Cotton run the port scripts before the night they check them.
There is still no word on making the boxheads site viewable by WMU students on Campus.
The will need to pick up a machine that is already configured for DHCP and firewalling from Matt if he doesn&rsquo;t show up before the LAN and if they cannot Brian has suggested they could use a machine in the LABs that are used for the networking classes.
Other options are Nick could come down with his machine.
Matt called Eric during the meeting and proclaimed he will be able to come down and bring the server.
Eric Proclaims the LAN party planning is going smoothly, Jim Cottons phone number has been added to Geekboys database by Tim.
The computer club will be purchasing a chest freezer for the LAN and for other events. cost: $140 it was voted by all if favor to do so.
The chest freezer will be left in the computer club and may contain Ice cream for purchase during the year.
7:34PM - Chris arrives

2) HAM radio class:
Status of the rooms is still uncertain. Tim stated he&rsquo;ll check on the rooms.
Eric Drew a map to show Tim where the room he needs to go is.
We need to fax a purchasing order to Amazon for the books. it needs to include the promise that we were offered a discount for the books. Tim questioned where to have the books sent. Tim suggested the CS office.
committed: Eric, Tim, Brian, Joe W., Chris, Matt L., and an annonymous individual who e-mailed Tim.
Miles would if someone purchases the book for him.
No knowledge on the test yet. Preparations for the Class seem to be going well.
There is no gaurentee we will be able to sell books to everyone. 2005-06-02">

Brian attempted to reserve LAN rooms
Still need to follow up.  We have some flyers at
http://www.whatistheplan.com/flyers.  We want to post flyers earlier than usual
in order to get more interest built up.  We&rsquo;ll also advertise online.

We are trying to reserve from Friday to Sunday on that week.  It will be a
multi-day event.  We need to get into the other room to get the port numbers
for the reservation of the other script.  We are have interest in an Xbox
room. 2005-05-12">

Firewall report
It has a prompt, so it&rsquo;s good.  We need a 16 bit networking card.  We can
continue to look for PCI cards or put in a different machine.  Nik offers a
Celeron 300.  Tim suggests we check Marvin for a 16 bit NIC. 


Flyer for lan party
It was denied.  It did not say that it was sponsored by the Computer Club.
Oops.  We had a whole bunch of flyers last time.  Joe G. asks for other
designs.  Please remember to include date, price, organization, location. 2005-02-24">

Gratitude to Tim, Tim&rsquo;s dad, Isaac, Chris and Joe for the work in the
office.
The office now has shelf space and it looks really nice.  Some books, sadly,
were thrown out.  So we do know how to sacrifice.  Several &lsquo;70&rsquo;s area theses
hit the trash.


The LAN party rooms are officially reserved.  
We need ports for the room for VLANing on the day.  We will also need the ports
for the spillover space.  We will need to have Computer Club staff in the
spillover room if we need it. 2005-02-03">

Mail
Problem occurred between OIT, CS and Yakko.  Ed fixed.  Mail from CS is working
now as well.  Sendmail was doing strange things.  Mail was going in and coming
out, but we don&rsquo;t know where it was going.

Mail loops are not good!  Hal now knows how to deliver mail to yakko.


Webpages
Apparently, SSL is working, but there is more to do with the SSL aliases which
were not ported from the old yakko.  Ed is trying to organize it all. 2005-01-27">

The server is serving.  Joe commends us for a fantastic job.  We migrated in 3
days and we&rsquo;re back to 90%.  We still need to fix mail.  It was working, but
now it&rsquo;s stopped.  We can send mail and transmit/receive within the Univ.

Our microwave DIDN&rsquo;T vanish
Anyone need an old, heavy radioactive microwave?  Also, other junk needs to
disappear.  Joe wanted the lamp to disappear, but was outvoted.


We have temporary shelving.
Joe developed a temporary solution to the problem of lack of shelving by using
our problem of too many worthless books to our advantage.

ever saying such a thing.  A few complaints were registered about

Thanks to Tim and Joe for unteryakko.
Joe and Tim installed a new machine under the Debian OS.  It&rsquo;s accessible via gasiorek.homelinux.com.  To gain access, contact Joe.  Isaac and Joe purchased some material.  

Isaac and Joe were paid.


Renewal checks have been received from several members.
Accounts have been updated for these members.


The individual running the PCI graduate profile project contacted Joe.
This is regarding a new list that Joe has been setting up for their group.  Issues were resolved regarding adding users to the list.  Mailman&rsquo;s configuration options were causing problems, and Joe discovered that Mailman&rsquo;s configuration options don&rsquo;t make sense. 2005-01-06">

We are registered with SOAP.
The computer club is now antibacterial.  It is a way to automatically
re-register us rather than having to file with the OCL every year. 


Tim suggests that we do another Chicago trip.
We stopped going years ago and perhaps we could resume our trips.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s
a good idea, but Joe voiced concerns about the possibility of bad weather. 2004-11-18">

1&gt; Lan party went well.
Exact counts not available, but we took in about $200 net.
Do we want to do it again?  Yes.  We want to have Jan 29th as a tentative date.
Bryan and Eric started advertisement.  Issues to address in the future: Power
for the food stand.  Apparently we had electricity issues.  Also, the
tournament took too long.   2004-11-11">

1&gt; The radio was reset
WIDR stream had static.
2&gt; Eric was slapped for mentioning Gentoo.
Update requests were made for PHP to be upgraded to the newest version.  The
general consensus was that it&rsquo;s not doable at this time.
3&gt; Lan party
Tournaments will be for Doom 3 and UT2k4.  16 player double elimination.  It
will be tight, so we will need dedicated servers to be running the whole time.
Prizes will include $50 gift cards for Best Buy.  It might be crazy due to the
time constraints.  Brian has developed a time structure.  Joe asks for a copy
of the schedule. 2004-10-28">

Discussion of the WIDR stream
It&rsquo;s still working, apparently.  Isaac explained how the stream works.


Spread Firefox is taking out a full page ad in the NY Times to promote the

They are taking donations and they put your name in readable font

1&gt; Dot was down for a few hours.  
We&rsquo;re blaming one of those ECE guys for pulling the plug or something.  Anyway,
it&rsquo;s plugged in now.
2&gt; We really need keys to this building
Eric also needs help with the office.

Tim bailed out due to excessive studying.
Chris offered to do a voip-asterisk.
Eric offered to do GTK programming.
Other topics were suggested.  If you would like to present on something, send

We plugged in wakko. 
It worked, but we&rsquo;re still not Vlaned.  WIDR reception was tested and found to
be somewhat lacking.  Joe complained about the lack of space in the office.


Eric suggested that we put a notice in the Glances in the Western
Herald.
Ed revealed his fascination with cron jobs.

The little fridge is dead.  
Eric proposes that it be thrown out, since it has a large colony of mold which
has taken up residence in the fridge and will probably never be worthy of being
used.  Motion carries.


The dates are being changed for the presentations. 
Eric will present on basic unix next week.  Tim will follow with debugging
techniques and Joe will follow on Linux GUIS.  The web site has been changed to

Club representatives met with Dr. Guizani and talked to him about space for the club on the new campus. He said he&rsquo;s very willing to help in any way he can and asked for a list of every service we&rsquo;ve ever provided so it can be presented to the Dean of engineering. Dr. Guizani would like to push our tutoring services for computer science and engineering. If this doesn&rsquo;t work we will have to meet with the dean ourselves.  2003-02-20">

If the club doesn&rsquo;t secure a new office in Kohrman Hall, there is a chance that we could be withouat an office once the space here in Dunbar is reallocated 
It seems that there was a presentation yesterday about an embedded platform that was mostly software related. We are thinking about setting up a mailman account so that we will be notified of any and all presentations that will interest the members of the computer club. Efforts will be made to increase ties between engineering and computer science here on campus. We will try to find the presenter to see if it would be possible to have the presentation given here.   2003-01-30">

Status of Yakko: It&rsquo;s ZIF socket melted and there was a psychedelic  dreamshow and now we&rsquo;re stuck with unteryakko until we get a new mobo and ram (potentially), and a new CPU. 
The debate now is whether our replacement board will be a dual-Athlon board. The consensus seems to be against getting a dual-Athlon board because it&rsquo;d be a waste of our money.  2002-03-28">

Speaker: Wes heard from him in December and recommended a date but hasn&rsquo;t heard back from him yet. Tentatively it was February 12-14 that we&rsquo;re planning on his presentation.  We want to have at least two weeks to publicize so first we definitely need to tack down a date.  2002-01-10">

Laptop rant: Wes is looking for a laptop without XP on it.  In other words, he&rsquo;s looking for an Affordable Computer. 
Partition Magic and Windows XP are not very compatible when you install XP off of a recovery disk. So the plan is to check out the newer version of Partition Magic, possible via funding from GSAC. Reminder: Get quote and request funding from GSAC in December  2001-11-01">

Status of new webpage design: Isaac was working on stuff but he&rsquo;s not here.  He was working on the graphics and when that&rsquo;s done Wes will work on the PHP part. 
We have a Usenet server that is supplementing our cclub-gen and  cclub-announce mailing lists.

Bronco Bash is coming.  We&rsquo;ve sent in our spot request (early, imagine that!).  We&rsquo;ll give away free CDs and happiness.  A webcam we would be nice to set up at Bronco Bash.  Bronco Bash is on the first day of class on Monday. 

 Business cards, flyers, giant business cards, etc. would be cool.  It must all have the &#34;Fight Club&#34;-like logo.  The business cards will be like the  flyers but not as extravagant... and smaller.  Deciding what we&#39;re going to smash:  Computers, definitely the Mac.  All of our junk.  We have to be concerned about people&#39;s safety.  We could get a pick-axe or a hammer... but Matt says something one-handed.  We need free stuff to give away and sell at Bronco Bash.  We&#39;ll talk to Wes and see if the KLUG can&#39;t cook something up for us.  OS CDs as well as software that can be installed on the operating systems!  We were going to have T-shirts as well.  People at the table should be wearing the shirts, but we could also sell T-shirts.  We need to look into places that can make these shirts for us at an affordable price.    2001-07-12">

Erik&rsquo;s going to keep trying to get Bionic Arm to whip up some CDs and maybe make a theme song for the computer club. 
Vouchers are in for Uberyakko, people who pitched in should be getting payed soon. 
Bob was talking about the Geek Group.  How&rsquo;d they get their own building? They like playing with Tesla coils.  They get their money from having a legit business that makes big bucks.  Wes was curious about how we could learn from them so that the computer club could eventually get a building of their own.  2001-04-12">

Elect a treasurer.  Anne Marie is the only nomination.  That settles that. 
Wes has stuff for the treasurer. She gets the checkbook and a treasurer pass-over report thing.  We still need to figure out how to get control moved from Nike to whoever the current treasurer is when it happens. 
Wes also deposited:  2001-03-08">

Wes ordered the motherboard and CPU for Uberyakko.  ASUS A7B motherboard, 1.2GHz Thunderbird!  It has begun!  It cost about $450. 
Gonna attempt a kernel upgrade to 2.4.1 on Yakko tonight. 
Some of the projects can&rsquo;t be started until we get Uberyakko built. 
Isaac brought in a motherboard that anyone is free to try to identify  if they want.  2001-02-01">

Uberyakko: We can start buying any time now.  When should we actually order?  The meeting after the Install Party will be an Uberyakko buying  meeting!  Trenary says we can&rsquo;t use the departments charge card for these purchases and no one person can spend more than $500 on parts.  2001-01-18">

Movie part at pacd&rsquo;s.         This will happen at a time determined in last weeks minutes.     I looked it up.  It is April 21 at 7:00 p.m.     Directions are as follows: 
Location: 626 Summer Street     Time: Approx 7:00 pm     Date: Friday, April 21st     Considerations:     - Pleaes park in the street (not the driveway)     - bring your own beverages (alcohol, pop, tea, whatever)&ndash;we may pick up some 2 liters but I can&rsquo;t gurantee it     -pizza will be provided     - the movies selection is up in the air (look for something sci-fi)                           Directions:                            From downtown: Take Kalamazoo avenue West (away from BL-94 towards US-131), keep in the right lane.  The road forks, take it right (you&rsquo;re now on Douglas), hang a left at the stop light (you are now on North), take a left on the first street, which is Summer St.  The house is 3rd on the left, grey, kind of big and crappy looking.                             From Campus: Take Stadium towards downtown, keep left.  Get in the lane that goes to Elm Crossover and take that over to Elm.  Take elm north and then hang a left on Kalamzoo ave (see above for the rest of the story).                                                        Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t get a real map drawn&hellip; there was just no time (you can probably pull one up on mapquest if you need it).                                                                                 2.

o Pop and candy prices are debating being raised. Isaac says pop should stay  the same since there isn&rsquo;t even a pop machine in this building. Much debate  ensues. The candy is more expensive and makes more of a dent; people REALLY  NEED TO STOP EATING AND THROWING CASH IN WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT! Even if  we make an cash/inventory flow sheet, people are going to have to track each  and every sale&hellip;there is no substitute for getting your ducks in a row.  Ozz wishes to track the problem for a month and see how bad it is before we  decide on a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; that might end up backfiring. After all, as long as  we&rsquo;re not losing hand over fist, it&rsquo;s just good will/advertising for us. So  the accounts will be tracked for a month starting with the next store run,  and we&rsquo;ll have another report at the end of the summer.  1999-06-17">

Steve: Since I wasn&rsquo;t here last week, congrats to all the new officers. Thanks to all old officers for their assistance this past year. Two more meetings this year, no meeting the week of finals, so I&rsquo;d like to start new officers in their positions with this meeting, and let old officers train them for the remainder of the year.

Steve: First and foremost, Chicago trip is next Saturday. Dennis acquired a vehicle. When does everyone want to leave Saturday? Does 8am work for all? (Trip takes about 3 hours.) We&rsquo;ll meet at the front door/lobby of Dunbar. Plan is to arrive 10am Chicago time, leave between 8-9pm and return around 11pm our time. Bring money for food, Battletech, and whatever else we come across (museums, miscellaneous). Bonnie needs names and SS numbers for all who will be going, so get this to me if you haven&rsquo;t already. I have 13 so far, give or take some; the van supposedly seats 15. Who wants to drive? I suppose I can drive if Tim hasn&rsquo;t had enough sleep, but I&rsquo;ll need a map and a navigator&hellip;Darron&rsquo;s nominated. Give us suggestions for things to do; Tim wants to hit the Three-Story Bookstore&hellip; Good places to eat, for instance.  1998-02-26">

Steve: Officers still needed. At the end of this meeting we&rsquo;ll do more temporary nominations. 
Chicago trip still looks good. At last count I had about ten people who were interested. Remember, non-club members are welcome, just let me know. Final headcount is necessary to determine if extra vehicle(s) are needed. 
Tim: I&rsquo;ll make calls to reserve the van. I believe 14-15 can be fit in it. Is there anything else?  Everyone bring money. Bookstores, Museum of Science and Industry&hellip; Battletech is something like $11/person. Would be nice to have some non-videogame things for the girlfriends coming along&hellip;  1998-02-19">

6:15pm, we start. 
Steve: I got email from Mike Martins, assistant to Diether. I had mailed him asking about the webpage situation. His response is that Diether and he want to resolve this within the next couple of weeks, and he will get back to me when a date and time have been sent. Dr. Kapenga sent everyone his proposal for equipment, which dramatically undercut everyone else&rsquo;s estimate (by a factor of ten or so!), which apparently weighed heavily in their decision. I think the meeting will boil down to sheer policy. I&rsquo;ll be there, as will Tim; Kapenga and Trenary should show also. Unknown if Dr. Wright will be there &ndash; he has no relation to us, he passed the buck to Diane Schwartz, so we shall see.  1998-02-12">

Office hours.  Everyone mailed.  That looks good, since the crucial hours 12-1 are covered.  If you need to add more or change them, talk to steve. Steve will print up something to hang on door. 
Chicago trip.  Tentative March 7th, last sat of the spring break.  The spring break starts Mar 2 and resume 9th.  Most people will be probably back by then.

Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know what the duties are, or wants more information, can either read the Club Constitution on our web page, http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/general/new.const or ask any existing officer who holds a position you&rsquo;re interested in.

2) Officers: we need new officers to take over for next year.  Steve and Dennis are leaving, Darron and Tim have done everything already.  Basically, we are creating officer training program for CCLUB.  We are looking for recruits or getting more involved will be asked to talk to Steve and help them with questions.

Steve: Not much this week. I still need office hours. If you don&rsquo;t have a key and would like to hold one, let me know and one can be copied for you, or we can set one as a floating key again. 
We need new officers! If you will be around next year&hellip; I&rsquo;d like to have &ldquo;officer training&rdquo; for those who might be nervous about taking on the responsibility; folks can tag along behind current officers and see how things are done. Attendance in general is down, and fresh blood would be appreciated. Being an officer isn&rsquo;t too hard, and it&rsquo;s a great way to get more involved with the club. As far as I know we have nobody interested in being President, Vice President, etcetera&hellip; I know I can&rsquo;t think of anyone who wants my job , but we NEED officers; it&rsquo;s what makes us a student organization and not just a bunch of folks who sit around drinking pop and playing on computers.

When we&rsquo;re down to one box, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see how many more we&rsquo;ll need &ndash; Pietkowski said he had 47 students registered. As of now we have almost paid for the copies. All monies received, cash or check, go in their own envelope separate from the normal cash box, which Dennis will be depositing every day or two. Make change from the envelope if possible, if not, please note discrepancies. Coursepacks are 40 bucks. Pietkowski is very much in favor of doing this with us again&hellip;BUT&hellip;  1998-01-08">

Coursepacks are going well.  Emailed piat and told him we&rsquo;re ready to go. Talked to office max copy desk.  $.025 per image.  How much can we charge?  We desperately need office hours!  All officers will need to report. 
Email steve.  Other people needed for 9-5 coverage.  $500 for 40 coursepacks is cclub costs.  $12.50 per pack our costs.    1997-12-11">

Members present: Tim Miley, Steve Sedore, James Nelli, Dennis Huppertz, Darron Christian, Wesley Leonard, Kelly Weaver, Ian Schirado, Kim Mack. 

Steve talked to herald about article councerning our recent brouhaha about the whole incident involving Wright and get any progress on the web issue and the recent snooping.  Dr. Trenary set up meeting with Dr. W. and at the last  minute, he cancelled.  Dr. T and Steve were annoyed.  Email exchanges occurred  recently claiming that &ldquo;students think they have a god given right&hellip;&rdquo; and   pungent quotes from Dr. W and other misc. stupid comments.  Steve Told Herald  that Dr W has been unwilling to work with us or talk to us.  Dr. T has also  been snubbed, all meetings cancelled.  Whole mood of article is Wright&rsquo;s  unwillingness to meet and discuss issue.  No one should be happy about his  attitude.  Dr W claims he was quietly working behind the scenes to help set up  web issues.  Steve wants to hear what Dr W tells Emily from Herald.   Emily was very responsive and interested in the situation.  1997-12-04">

We plan on short and sweet, our agendas are efficient. 
Steve: I got email about the course packs and will meet with the good doctor tomorrow to speak. He sounds still interested. The only problem will be getting office hours sufficient to keep our office open from 9 to 5; if we can&rsquo;t have someone in here at all times during the first three weeks, I don&rsquo;t see much point on doing this. It would be a great fund raiser, but if people can&rsquo;t come in and get them, it will make the club look bad and make our clients (profs) peeved. After I speak with him, I&rsquo;ll see exactly what he has; I know he has at least one big one of 150-200 pages. I&rsquo;ll review everyone&rsquo;s office hours, and people should contact me SOON &ndash; by Monday &ndash; to let me know their availability.  1997-11-13">

The scoop about our web space : 	-Monday, yakko was booted off the network for 5 hours some 	 time in the morning.  Dr. Nelson later informed Ken Theis 	 to remove our web pages per order of Richard Wright.   	 Apparently, a directive was issued 5 years ago stating 	 that student web pages are restricted due to bandwidth  	 problems.  However, finding this documentation seems to  	 be a problem.   	-The k-12 parent : 	   Basically, all this was started by a parent searching the 	   web (we think key-wording sex or nudity whatever) and  	   running across a C-Club members OWN home page in which a 	   tasteful black and white photo of THEMSELF was posted.  She 	   became irate and called Richard Wright.  From here, he passed  	   judgment, claiming that he hadn&rsquo;t known about our web 	   page activities, and issued a disable command through 	   to Dr. Nelson.        	-Bandwidth issues : 	   The university is currently connected to a T1 line that 	   connects us to the internet and has a trans rate of 1.544 	   million bits per second.  The word is that this line is  	   operating at only about 30%.   	-Wright&rsquo;s decision : 	     He seems to think that all the traffic goes through 	   tigger, slowing it down, slowing the modems down and 	   taking up too much disk space on tigger. 	     He wants to moves us to the DOSAWEB server in the            office of student services if we are to even have a            web page.              Basically he doesn&rsquo;t want us to have our own web space 	   for student accounts.  We can keep Yakko&rsquo;s web page, but 	   that is it for right now.  He doesn&rsquo;t think it is fair for 	   us to have pages and not everyone else.  So for 6 months 	   until the University can offer student web pages, we won&rsquo;t 	   be able to activate ours, maybe not at all, since the  	   university won&rsquo;t have control over our pages. 	-Our immediate response : 	   Tim, jay and others within the C-Club immediately got on 	   the phone trying to get in touch with Wright.  When  	   contact was finally reached a day and 1/2 later, Wright 	   was not too friendly, nor willing to talk reasonably to  	   either jay or tim.  We are also in touch with channel 3,  	   the Western Herald, soon the Kalamazoo Gazette, students 	   from various Universities, and CS faculty. 	   Letters have been written and delivered to Diether Haenicke 	   and various others concerning this matter.  Yakko&rsquo;s  	   web pages has gotten a complete overhaul,      1997-03-20">

Grainne Matthew&rsquo;s project    Project involves seeing how subjects detect defective parts in 70 minutes duration.  The speed of the activity determines how paid.  Paid for each correct screen.    The program has to allow the subject to play game for 5 minutes.  Program probably needs to be done on Windows or Unix environments, unless Mac is possible.    Programmer will be responsible for making the program that stops the simulation periodically to offer to let the subject play the game.  The game must play for either 5 minutes, or until the subject stops the game.    Interested programming students may contact Grainne Matthews at 349-2314.  1996-03-07">

Care-a-van    We agreed that we will not be able to continue the project until after school is back in session, due to project member conflicts. 
Motherboard    DX4-120 available from strange named place costs $180.  We will ask for 512k of cache.  We could also try safer suppliers for larger companies.  PC Importers and Global are good.  Hard drive cost ~$300.  Tim says we have about $1000 in the bank, so we should have enough money to purchase the motherboard.    Safer retailers would cost about $250.  We would like to upgrade the motherboard at the same time as the hard drive.  We voted to purchase the motherboard.  1996-02-22">

Graphics project    John is interested in doing graphics/sound project.  Jay suggests a logo for the group.  We may wish to make our web pages more readable as well.  John has no specific items in mind.  Jay has some experience with POV.      The projects would probably be computation-intensive, so running on Yakko would not be wise.  Tim asks, &ldquo;What can POV do?&rdquo;  Jay explains it uses a 3 dimensional universe consisting of objects of various geometric objects to construct an image and you tell the camera position to produce movement.    Suns would be a good thing to use.  We could also use Multi-process POV and we could use Grog system to multiprocess image.    Jay offers his research account for parallel processing and POV.  His research account is designated for that use.    Suggested projects includes a map of Western for tracing.  Even more interesting (grant possibility) could be a walk-through for directing newbies around campus using kiosks.    It might take a month to enter the data and another month(?) to render.    Tim works for Geography department and will check on a very accurate campus map.  Very high or very low quality, depending on time you have to render it.    The mapping could be split up into parts, with each of the participating members mapping out a building or terrain.  We have a choice of frontends on different architecture.    We need a topographical map of the campus to produce the example.    We would like to do Dunbar, Dalton, Sprau, Miller, Brown, Fountain, and Shaw.  We should check into getting copies of maps from Campus planning and get building dimensions.  1996-01-25">
