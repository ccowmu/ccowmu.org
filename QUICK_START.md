## Adding New Meeting Minutes

1. **Create the file:**

   cd minutes/content/
   
   # Create new file with date format YYYYMMDD.md
   touch 20250123.md  # example for January 23, 2025
   ```

2. **Add front matter:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Meeting Minutes â€“ 01/23/2025"
   date: 2025-01-23
   ---
   ```

3. **Add content:**
